# Config sources — what lives in `data/` and where it comes from

ATT ships a tree of config files under
`usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/data/`. Some of those files are **copies of
configs owned by another repo** (edu-shells, edu-dot-files, kiro-iso, …). Those
copies have no automated sync, so they silently drift from what a real Kiro
system ships — and ATT actively *writes its copies onto the user's system* (e.g.
the "Install the ATT config.fish" button in `shell.py`), so the drift is
functional, not cosmetic.

This document classifies every `data/` entry into one of three buckets and
records the canonical source for the ones ATT should fetch rather than
hand-maintain.

## The three buckets

### MIRROR — fetched, never hand-edited
Same file the system ships; ATT only carries a copy. These are listed in
[`data-sources.tsv`](data-sources.tsv) and should be pulled fresh from their
source repo (GitHub raw, `main`) at sync time. **Edit the source repo, not the
copy here.**

| `data/` path | Canonical source | Drift @ 2026-05-25 |
|---|---|---|
| `config.fish` | `edu-shells:etc/skel/.config/fish/config.fish` | 49 lines |
| `.bashrc` | `edu-shells:etc/skel/.bashrc-latest` (note the `-latest` suffix) | 6 lines |
| `.zshrc` | `edu-shells:etc/skel/.zshrc` | 8 lines |
| `fastfetch/config.jsonc` | `edu-dot-files:etc/skel/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc` | 1 line |
| `gpg.conf` | `edu-dot-files:usr/local/share/kiro/gpg.conf` | 2 lines |
| `variety/variety.conf` | `edu-variety-config:etc/skel/.config/variety/variety.conf` | 2 lines |

#### PENDING — source unresolved
`nano/nanorc`, `sddm/sddm.conf`, `sddm.conf.d/kde_settings.conf` exist **only** in
the kiro-iso archiso tree, which is **not fetchable via public GitHub raw**
(`github.com/erikdubois/kiro-iso` → 404; private or unpushed). No public `edu-*`
package ships them. They are commented out in `data-sources.tsv` until a public
source is chosen (e.g. fold them into `edu-system-files`) or they're reclassified
as OWN. Note `nanorc`/`sddm.conf` are already 0-line in sync, so the urgency is
low; `kde_settings.conf` is 4 lines off.

### OWN — ATT-specific, never fetch
ATT intentionally ships something different from the system default — that's the
tweak tool's job. These stay hand-maintained here.

- `bin/` — ATT's own helper scripts (`att-fix-pacman-conf`, `fix-sddm-config`, …)
- `pacman/pacman.conf` — a **stripped baseline**: multilib + `nemesis_repo` +
  `chaotic-aur` removed on purpose, because ATT's Pacman page enables them via
  its own toggles (`check_nemesis_repo_active()` / `check_chaotic_aur_active()`).
  Mirroring the canonical (repos pre-enabled) would break that toggle model.
- `pacman/blank/pacman.conf` — reset-to-vanilla template
- `samba/att/smb.conf`, `samba/example/smb.conf` — no ecosystem source
- `variety/scripts/*` — ATT's wallpaper logic (`n_kiro`, `set_wallpaper_kiro`, …)
- `nemesis_packages.txt` — generated
- `wallpaper/wallpaper.jpg` — bundled fallback
- `cursor/index.theme` — ATT default; no clear ecosystem cursor source

### VENDORED — upstream binaries, refresh separately
Dated `.pkg.tar.zst` artifacts bundled for offline bootstrap. Not config
mirrors, but they go stale and need periodic refresh from upstream:

- `chaotic/keyring/chaotic-keyring-*.pkg.tar.zst`
- `chaotic/mirrorlist/chaotic-mirrorlist-*.pkg.tar.zst`
- `cachyos/keyring/cachyos-keyring-*.pkg.tar.zst`
- `cachyos/mirrorlist/cachyos-mirrorlist-*.pkg.tar.zst`
- `packages/keyring/archlinux-keyring-*.pkg.tar.zst`

Refresh these with **`vendored-refresh.sh`** (repo root): it re-downloads each
from upstream, derives the real versioned filename from the package's own
`.PKGINFO`, prunes the older copy, and drops the new one in. It does not
commit. `up.sh` runs it automatically (non-fatal — a mirror outage won't block
the push) before its commit/push step, so a normal `up.sh` keeps the bundled
packages current; it can also be run standalone. Note it hits upstream mirrors
on every invocation. Upstream endpoints are constants at the top of the script
— that is the place to look if a refresh ever fails.

## Source-repo layouts differ
Most MIRROR sources are skel/package paths in **edu-shells / edu-dot-files**, but
`nanorc` + the two sddm files live **directly in kiro-iso** (ISO-native, no
separate package). A fetch script must handle both repo layouts.

## Status
- **VENDORED refresh: implemented** — `vendored-refresh.sh` handles the bundled
  `.pkg.tar.zst` artifacts (run manually; see the VENDORED section above).
- **MIRROR fetch: not yet implemented** — there is no automatic config-fetch step
  wired into `up.sh` yet. This doc + `data-sources.tsv` are the classification;
  the `fetch-configs.sh` step (for the MIRROR config files) is the next piece of work.
- This is the ATT-side companion to the HQ TODO *"Audit which files the ISO build
  should fetch fresh from repos at build time."* One manifest concept could serve
  both the ISO build and ATT.
