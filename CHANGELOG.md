# Arch Linux Tweak Tool — Changelog

## 2026.05.13 - TODO housekeeping: button messaging audit, per-page UX bugs

### What Changed

- Added "Button Messaging Audit" section: test every button for notification bar + console log output; on pure Arch any button requiring a disabled repo must communicate this clearly
- Added "Fastfetch Page" section: enable toggle must snap back to off and notify when fastfetch is not installed
- Added "Shell Page" section: zsh "Installed" label after install; decision item for bashrc immediate-apply vs logout notice
- Added "hblock Page" section: enable fails silently on pure Arch — investigate and fix or explain
- Added "Performance Page" section: tuned/tuned-ppd and irqbalance buttons stay greyed out after install; gamemode missing "Installed" label + greyed buttons; ananicy false install notification in both notification bar and console log
- Added "SDDM Page" section: URGENT — remove install/enable option for plasma-login-manager
- Added "Services Page" section: cups, cups-pdf missing "Installed" label after install; system-config-printer "Installed" label not cleared after removal
- Added "Software/Packages Page" section: octopi silent failure; yay-git/paru-git popup offer to build from AUR if chaotic-AUR absent; inxi auto-display after install; variety buttons stay greyed after install

### Technical Details

- All greyed-button issues share the same root cause: UI sensitivity is not re-evaluated after the install terminal closes; fix is the `wait_and_refresh` pattern throughout
- ananicy issue: `log_*` calls and notification fire before (not after) checking install state
- plasma-login-manager removal is a correctness fix: offering to install/enable it would break the SDDM tab's own `check_service_enabled("plasma-login")` guard

## 2026.05.12 - TODO housekeeping: scripts audit, new scripts, termite leftover investigation

### What Changed

- Added "Scripts Audit" section to TODO.md: task to grep all Python source for `data/bin/` calls and identify any unused scripts
- Added "New Scripts" section to TODO.md: two paired entries — `get-chadwm-on-att` and `get-ohmychadwm-on-att`
- Added "~/.config/archlinux-tweak-tool/ Cleanup" section to TODO.md: investigation revealed `settings.ini` in that directory contains stale termite config written by an old arco-era ATT; the word "termite" no longer appears anywhere in the current codebase

### Technical Details

- `fn.config` (defined in `functions.py:233`) points to `~/.config/archlinux-tweak-tool/settings.ini`; the directory is created at startup by `functions_makedir.py:115`; nothing in the current codebase writes termite config there — the file is a leftover from a previous arco-era version of ATT

## 2026.05.12 - Codebase improvements: pkg cache, naming cleanup, up.sh auto-pull

### What Changed

- `check_package_installed()` and `check_service_enabled()` now cache results per session — eliminates redundant pacman/systemctl subprocesses on repeated calls across tab builds
- Cache is automatically invalidated after any install or remove terminal closes (in `wait_install_and_update` and `wait_remove_and_update`)
- Page-title labels in 5 files changed from `set_text()` to `set_markup("<b>...</b>")` for consistency with the rest of the codebase
- `autostart.py`: renamed all numbered/collision widget names to descriptive identifiers; also fixed page title to use `set_markup`
- `up.sh`: added `git pull --rebase` at the top so multi-machine runs sync before committing; removed duplicate bare `git commit -m "update"` on line 28 that always errored or double-committed

### Technical Details

- Cache dicts `_pkg_cache` and `_svc_cache` declared at module level in `functions.py` alongside existing `_pacman_conf_cache`; `invalidate_pkg_cache()` clears both
- `autostart.py` variable collision fixed: `lbl1` was used for both the page title and the "Name" form field; split into `lbl_title`, `lbl_name`, `lbl_command`, `lbl_comment`; `self.txtbox1/2/3` → `self.entry_name/command/comment`
- `git pull --rebase` chosen over plain `git pull` to keep history linear on multi-machine workflow

## 2026.05.12 - SDDM theme dropdown unconditional refresh + leftover dir cleanup

### What Changed

- Theme dropdown on the SDDM page now always refreshes after the Remove Simplicity button's terminal closes
- `/usr/share/sddm/themes/edu-simplicity` is now explicitly deleted after package removal — pacman leaves the directory behind when the user applied a custom wallpaper (the modified file is no longer tracked by the package)

### Technical Details

- `on_click_remove_simplicity` `refresh()` now: (1) checks if the theme directory still exists and removes it with `shutil.rmtree`; (2) calls `pop_theme_box` unconditionally at the end so the dropdown always reflects the actual filesystem state
- Root cause: ATT's "Apply wallpaper" copies a file into `/usr/share/sddm/themes/edu-simplicity/images/background.jpg`; pacman removes only files it installed, so any overwritten/added files leave the directory alive after `pacman -R`

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/sddm.py`

## 2026.05.12 - Right-click browser picker on all link buttons

### What Changed

- Every "link" button on the AI page now shows a right-click popover with a browser picker and a "Copy URL" fallback — solves the issue of `xdg-open` not working on certain desktops
- Same right-click behaviour added to the "more info" labels on the Kernel page
- All 16 AI-page link button URLs extracted as module-level constants in `ai.py` (single source of truth)
- Browser-picker helpers (`attach_link_context_menu`, `_show_browser_popover`, `get_installed_browsers`, etc.) live in `functions.py` so any page can reuse them without cross-feature imports

### Technical Details

- `fn.attach_link_context_menu(self, widget, url)` attaches a `Gtk.GestureClick` (button 3) to any widget; on fire it builds a `Gtk.Popover` parented to that widget, positioned at the cursor via `Gdk.Rectangle`, listing all detected browsers
- `_KNOWN_BROWSERS` scans 11 known binary paths at click time (no startup cost); "No browsers detected" shown if none found
- `open_url_with_browser` launches the chosen browser as the real user (`sudo -u $USER DISPLAY=:0 binary url`) and logs the action via `fn.log_info`
- `_copy_url_to_clipboard` writes to `Gdk.Display.get_default().get_clipboard()` and fires an in-app notification
- `Gdk` promoted from a local import inside `update_image` to the top-level `gi.repository` import line in `functions.py`
- `ai_gui.py` calls `fn.attach_link_context_menu` (not `ai.`); `ai.py` no longer imports `Gtk`/`Gdk`

## 2026.05.12 - Distro detection refactor + dead code audit

### What Changed

- Replaced hardcoded `change_distro_label()` mapping with `get_distro_label()` that greps `/etc/os-release` directly; `IMAGE_ID=kiro` checked before `ID=arch` so Kiro is correctly identified even though its base `ID` is `arch`
- Sidebar now shows one label (`get_distro_label()`) instead of two; `change_distro_label()` removed entirely
- Dead amos/archcraft distro-specific block removed from `fastfetch_gui.py` (was behind `fn.distr == "amos"` / `fn.distr == "archcraft"` guards that can never fire in ATT)
- Dead `btn_dark_theme` removed from `gui.py` — button was built and connected but `hbox6` was never appended to `ivbox`, making it permanently invisible
- Empty `hbox5` (spacer with no children) removed from `gui.py`
- `settings` import removed from `gui.py` — only user was the dark theme button
- Full `vulture --min-confidence 80` audit: 11 GTK callback parameters renamed with `_` prefix; 3 unused function parameters renamed
- All numbered hbox/vbox names in `gui.py` replaced with descriptive identifiers (`hbox_notification`, `vbox_content`, `hbox_ff_title`, `hbox_ff_separator`, `hbox_restart_att`, `hbox_quit_att`)

### Technical Details

- `get_distro_label()` reads `/etc/os-release` as plain text and checks for known `ID=` / `IMAGE_ID=` strings in priority order; falls back to `distr` (the `distro.id()` result) if no match found
- `change_distro_label()` was the only caller-facing display function; all three call sites (`gui.py`, `fastfetch_gui.py`, internal) now use `get_distro_label()`
- `vulture` installed from `extra/vulture`; use `vulture usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/ --min-confidence 80` for future audits

## 2026.05.12 - Fix GUI app launches on Plasma/Wayland (NyArch)

### What Changed

- `edu-powermenu` failed to launch from ATT on Plasma/NyArch because `~` in the powermenu script expanded to `/root` — root's HOME — not the real user's home; fixed by setting `HOME` in `get_terminal_env()`
- All system-page GUI app launches (gparted, alacritty viewers) failed on Plasma/Wayland because `_run_cmd` passed no display environment; fixed by passing `fn.get_terminal_env()` in `_run_cmd`

### Technical Details

- `get_terminal_env()` now sets `env["HOME"] = home` (real user's home) in addition to `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` — ensures `~` expands correctly in any script launched via `runuser`
- `_run_cmd` in `system.py` now captures `fn.get_terminal_env()` before spawning the thread and passes it to `Popen` — covers gparted and all alacritty info viewers on that page

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/functions.py`

## 2026.05.11 - Plymouth: fix combined quiet/splash patch (cmdline + entries always run together)

### What Changed

- `on_sdboot_fix_clicked` was branching on `_use_cmdline`: when True it patched only `/etc/kernel/cmdline` and skipped entries entirely, so `refresh_sdboot_status` (which checks both) never saw `all_ok = True` and the warning never cleared
- Fixed by merging `run_cmdline_fix` and `run_entries_fix` into a single `run_both` thread that always patches both targets in one operation — cmdline first (if it exists), then all entries with missing `quiet splash`
- `fn.log_subsection` and `fn.show_in_app_notification` now fire before the thread starts so the user sees immediate console + in-app feedback

### Technical Details

- Replaced three functions (`on_sdboot_fix_clicked`, `run_cmdline_fix`, `run_entries_fix`) with `on_sdboot_fix_clicked` + inline `run_both` closure
- `_use_cmdline` is still respected inside `run_both` — cmdline patch runs only when `/etc/kernel/cmdline` exists; entry patch always runs regardless

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/plymouth_gui.py`

## 2026.05.11 - Plymouth: flat single page + bootloader integration section

### What Changed

- Plymouth page restructured as one flat page with no conditional show/hide: all four sections always visible regardless of install state
- Sections follow the standard page pattern (separator + bold header + content rows): Install Plymouth, Bootloader Integration, Installed themes, Available themes
- "Install Plymouth" section shows the install button and a description at all times; green "Installed" label appears next to the button once plymouth is installed (or immediately on distros where it already is)
- Install script now uses `trap '...' EXIT` so the Alacritty terminal always waits for Enter even when a step fails with `set -euo pipefail`
- New **Bootloader Integration** section: detects systemd-boot, GRUB, limine, rEFInd; for systemd-boot scans all ESP path variants for entries missing `quiet splash` and offers a one-click fix; for GRUB checks `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` and offers a terminal-based fix that runs `grub-mkconfig`; limine and rEFInd show static info labels pointing to the right config file; mkinitcpio HOOKS ordering warning shown if `encrypt`/`lvm2` precedes `plymouth`
- OK/Installed status labels are plain bold — no green color

### Technical Details

- `plymouth_gui.py`: removed `vbox_not_installed`/`vbox_installed` wrappers and their `set_visible()` guards; flattened all widgets directly onto `vboxstack_plymouth`; added `lbl_plymouth_installed` with `set_visible(_plymouth_installed)`; `on_install_plymouth_done()` calls `lbl_plymouth_installed.set_visible(True)` and no longer toggles any container visibility; added bootloader section with 4 conditional widget groups; `on_sdboot_fix_clicked` patches entries in-process (no terminal needed); `on_grub_fix_clicked` runs in Alacritty terminal
- `plymouth.py`: added `detect_bootloader()`, `find_systemd_boot_entries()` (scans 5 path variants including `/boot/efi/loader/entries` for Kiro), `check_systemd_boot_splash()`, `check_grub_splash()`, `check_hooks_order()`
- Memory rule saved: systemd-boot entry paths must always scan all 5 variants — Kiro uses `/boot/efi/`, standard Arch uses `/boot/`

## 2026.05.11 - Plymouth: full install flow (pacman + mkinitcpio hook + initramfs rebuild); Plymouth tab always visible

### What Changed

- Plymouth tab now always visible in the sidebar regardless of whether `plymouth` is installed
- When Plymouth is not installed: tab shows an install button that runs the full 3-step setup in one Alacritty terminal: (1) `pacman -S --noconfirm plymouth`, (2) adds `plymouth` hook after `udev` in `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf` (backs up file first, skips if already present), (3) runs `mkinitcpio -P`
- After the terminal closes ATT re-checks install state and switches the tab from the "not installed" view to the full theme manager automatically — no restart required
- Both states (not-installed, installed) are built at startup using `vbox_not_installed` / `vbox_installed` with `set_visible()` toggling

### Technical Details

- `gui.py`: both `if fn.check_package_installed("plymouth"):` guards removed — tab always built and added to stack
- `plymouth_gui.py`: added `vbox_not_installed` with install button; existing content wrapped in `vbox_installed`; `_plymouth_installed = fn.check_package_installed("plymouth")` at build time drives initial visibility; `on_install_plymouth_done()` via `GLib.idle_add` toggles visibility and re-populates dropdowns; hook insert uses `sed -i 's/\budev\b/udev plymouth/'` (word-boundary anchors) with existence check to avoid duplicates

## 2026.05.11 - Plymouth: distro-agnostic detection + per-distro reset default; SDDM: service-enabled guard; Kernel: rEFInd default boot entry selector

### What Changed

- Plymouth tab now visible on any distro where `plymouth` is installed — previously Omarchy-only (required `plymouthd.conf` to contain "omarchy" or the ATT marker file)
- "Reset to default" button now shows the correct distro default theme per distro: `omarchy` on Omarchy, `cachyos-bootanimation` on CachyOS, `prismlinux-theme` on PrismLinux; button is hidden on distros not in the map
- ATT Omarchy marker (`/etc/att/att-omarchy-marker`) is now only written on Omarchy systems, not on every Plymouth apply
- SDDM tab hide condition replaced: was desktop-string check (`fn.desktop`); now hides when `systemctl is-enabled plasma-login.service` returns "enabled"; `fn.DEV` bypass removed — condition is unconditional
- Kernel tab "Default Boot Entry" now supports rEFInd (primary target: CachyOS): dropdown lists every `vmlinuz-*` found in `/boot`, "Set as Default" writes `default_selection "vmlinuz-<pkg>"` to `refind.conf` and also forces `fold_linux_kernels false`

### Technical Details

- `gui.py`: Plymouth guards changed from `check_content("omarchy", ...) or os.path.isfile(...)` to `fn.check_package_installed("plymouth")`
- `gui.py`: `_hide_sddm` removed entirely; replaced with `if not fn.check_service_enabled("plasma-login"):` — one line, no DEV bypass
- `functions.py`: added `check_service_enabled(service)` — runs `systemctl is-enabled <service>.service`, returns `True` if stdout is "enabled"; mirrors `check_service()` but uses `is-enabled` not `is-active`
- `plymouth_gui.py`: `_default_theme` dict maps `fn.distr` to the distro's default theme name; reset button hidden on unknown distros; marker write wrapped in `if fn.distr == "omarchy":` guard
- `kernel.py`: added `REFIND_CONF_PATHS`, `is_refind()`, `get_refind_boot_entries()`, `set_default_refind_entry()`, `_ensure_fold_linux_kernels_false()`; rEFInd detected before systemd-boot in bootloader chain
- `kernel_gui.py`: `_build_refind_entry_selector` mirrors limine selector pattern; bootloader chain checks rEFInd first

## 2026.05.10 - gui.py: SDDM tab guard refined to Plasma + plasma-login-manager condition

### What Changed

- SDDM tab visibility guard tightened: tab now hides only when all four conditions are true — CachyOS + Plasma desktop + `plasma-login-manager` installed + `plasmalogin` service active; previously it hid on any CachyOS system regardless of DE or service state, which wrongly hid SDDM for CachyOS users running non-Plasma DEs or WMs

### Technical Details

- `gui.py`: replaced `fn.distr != "cachyos"` with a `_hide_sddm` boolean derived from four `and`-chained checks: `fn.distr == "cachyos"`, `"plasma" in fn.desktop.lower()`, `fn.check_package_installed("plasma-login-manager")`, `fn.check_service("plasmalogin")`; `--dev` still forces the tab visible regardless

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/gui.py`

## 2026.05.10 - SDDM page: plasma-login-manager integration + CachyOS hide

### What Changed

- Added "Install and enable plasma-login-manager" button inside the SDDM installed view, between Configuration Setup and Login Settings — visible only when `plasma-login-manager` is already installed
- Button label set to "Switch back to plasma-login-manager" to reflect intent
- "You seem to be working with plasma-login-manager" info label now gated on both `check_package_installed("plasma-login-manager")` and `check_service("plasmalogin")` being true
- `on_click_enable_plasma_login` runs both `pacman -S plasma-login-manager` and `systemctl enable plasma-login-manager --force` visibly in Alacritty
- `on_click_sddm_enable` updated to also run `systemctl enable sddm --force` in the terminal before `set-default graphical.target`
- Removed redundant "Install plasma-login-manager and enable it" button from the "SDDM not installed" fallback view
- SDDM tab hidden on CachyOS by default (visible only with `--dev`) — CachyOS ships plasma-login-manager, not sddm

### Technical Details

- `sddm_gui.py`: new `hbox_plasma_login` row appended after `hbox_sep_config`, inside the `check_package_installed("plasma-login-manager")` guard
- `sddm.py`: new `on_click_enable_plasma_login(self, _widget=None)` function; cmd string split across lines for flake8 line-length compliance
- `sddm.py` `on_click_sddm_enable`: cmd updated to include `sudo systemctl enable sddm --force;` before `set-default`
- `gui.py`: `stack.add_titled(vboxstack_sddm, ...)` wrapped in `if fn.distr != "cachyos" or fn.DEV:` — page is still built so `self.rebuild_sddm_page` exists on all distros

## 2026.05.09 - SDDM page: multiple fixes + cursor preview + refactor

### What Changed

- SDDM page now detects both `sddm` and `sddm-git` as installed — previously only `sddm` triggered the UI
- "Apply the ATT SDDM configuration" button now creates backups of existing config files before overwriting (was silently overwriting without backup)
- "Apply your original SDDM configuration" button now actually restores from backup files; previously it was a stub that showed a success message and restarted without restoring anything; shows a clear dialog if no backup exists
- SDDM cursor theme row now shows a live cursor preview image, matching the same behaviour as the Maintenance page cursor selector
- plasma-login-manager row is now only shown when `plasma-login-manager` is installed; previously always visible on any SDDM system; label updated to "Switch back to plasma-login-manager" to reflect the actual use case

### Technical Details

- `sddm_gui.py` package guard: `or fn.check_package_installed("sddm-git")` added to line 25
- `on_click_sddm_reset_original_att`: imports `functions_backup` and calls `_fb.backup_system_configs()` before copying Kiro defaults
- `on_click_sddm_reset_original`: checks `fn.sddm_default_d1_bak` / `fn.sddm_default_d2_bak` exist, restores with `shutil.copy`, shows "No Backup Found" messagebox if absent
- Cursor preview refactor: xcursor binary-parsing helpers (`_load_xcursor_pixbuf`, constants) moved from `maintenance_gui.py` into `functions.py` as `_load_xcursor_pixbuf()` + `get_cursor_preview_pixbuf()`; `maintenance_gui._update_cursor_preview` now calls `fn.get_cursor_preview_pixbuf()`; `sddm.py` gets `_update_sddm_cursor_preview(self)` using the same shared helper; `sddm_gui.py` adds a `Gtk.Picture` widget wired to the existing cursor dropdown
- plasma-login-manager row wrapped in `if fn.check_package_installed("plasma-login-manager"):` so it only appears on Plasma systems that already have the package

## 2026.05.08 - Kernel page: GRUB full support + CachyOS native section fix

### What Changed

- CachyOS native kernel section now shows all cachyos-repo kernels (linux-cachyos, linux-cachyos-bore, etc.) regardless of whether chaotic-aur is active — previously they were filtered out when chaotic was enabled
- GRUB boot entry dropdown now includes entries from the "Advanced options" submenu, using GRUB's `N>M` index notation; fallback initramfs entries are filtered out
- Kernel install and remove now automatically run grub-install + grub-mkconfig in a separate alacritty terminal after pacman finishes, on GRUB systems only
- "Set as Default" on GRUB automatically fixes `GRUB_DEFAULT=saved` in `/etc/default/grub` if not set, runs grub update, then sets the default — no manual editing required
- GRUB boot entry selector is now shown to all users (removed `--dev` gate)
- Boot unavailable message updated to include GRUB

### Technical Details

- `_already_shown_pkgs()` in `_build_grub_entry_selector` now returns only non-chaotic packages (section 1 packages) — chaotic-flagged packages are no longer excluded from the CachyOS native section
- `get_grub_boot_entries()` tracks depth and `in_submenu` state; depth-1 menuentry lines inside a submenu block get index `"{submenu_idx}>{sub_entry_idx}"`; `sub_entry_index` still increments for filtered (fallback) entries so indices match what GRUB expects
- `run_grub_update(self)` is a new kernel.py function: checks `os.path.isfile("/usr/bin/grub-mkconfig")` + `os.path.isfile("/boot/grub/grub.cfg")` before launching; UEFI detection via `/sys/firmware/efi`; EFI dir detection via `mountpoint -q` checking `/boot/efi`, `/efi`, `/boot` in order; follows the 4-rule pattern: log_subsection → debug_print → show_in_app_notification → Popen
- All three post-terminal handlers in kernel_gui.py (`launch_and_wait`, `remove_and_notify`, `install_and_notify`) call `kernel.run_grub_update(self)` and `grub_proc.wait()` before the GLib.idle_add refresh
- `set_grub_default_saved()` uses `re.sub` to replace any existing `GRUB_DEFAULT=` line or appends if absent; called at click time, not page build time
- `on_set_default` restructured: if GRUB_DEFAULT not saved → fix file → hide note banner → daemon thread runs grub update → grub-set-default → GLib.idle_add finish; if already saved → direct grub-set-default

## 2026.05.08 - Fix: IndexError on startup when .zshrc has no ZSH_THEME line

### What Changed

- Fixed "ERROR DETECTED: list index out of range" logged at startup on systems where oh-my-zsh-git is installed but `~/.zshrc` contains no `ZSH_THEME=` line (e.g. CachyOS with a one-line sourcing zshrc)

### Technical Details

- Root cause: `zsh_theme.get_themes()` called `fn.get_position(theme_list, "ZSH_THEME=")` which returns `0` (not `-1`) when not found; `theme_list[0].split("=")[1]` then raised `IndexError` if the first line has no `=`
- Fix: added a guard — `if "ZSH_THEME=" not in theme_list[pos]: name = "random"` — before the split; defaults to "random" theme when the line isn't present

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/zsh_theme.py`

## 2026.05.08 - Dev mode: --dev flag for experimental UI

### What Changed

- Added `--dev` command-line flag to ATT; when passed, experimental or WIP UI elements are shown
- First use: Bazaar hbox on the Software page is hidden by default and only shown with `--dev`

### Technical Details

- `fn.DEV = False` constant + `fn.set_dev(value)` setter added to `functions.py`, mirroring the existing `DEBUG`/`set_debug` pattern
- `archlinux-tweak-tool.py` strips `--dev` from `sys.argv` and calls `fn.set_dev(True)` before GTK application starts
- `software_gui.py` wraps `vboxstack_software.append(hbox_bazaar)` with `if fn.DEV:` — hbox is still built so `self.lbl_software_bazaar` and `self.btn_software_bazaar_remove` attributes exist and won't cause AttributeError in callbacks
- Launch: `sudo python3 usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/archlinux-tweak-tool.py --dev`

## 2026.05.08 - Bazaar: fix launch env vars under pkexec

### What Changed

- Bazaar launch now passes `env=fn.get_terminal_env()` to both Popen calls so `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` are set correctly when ATT runs under pkexec
- Confirmed root cause: pkexec strips Wayland env vars; machines without them in the environment silently failed to connect to the display
- Issue partially resolved — launch works on some machines but still needs further diagnosis; tracked as open todo

### Technical Details

- Two Popen launch sites in `on_click_software_bazaar` updated: the direct-launch path (already installed) and the post-install auto-launch path
- `fn.get_terminal_env()` rebuilds `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` from `/run/user/<uid>/wayland-*` socket and sets `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/<uid>`
- `sudo -E` then passes these vars through to bazaar

## 2026.05.07 - Themes page: Plasma desktop warning

### What Changed

- Themes page now displays a warning for Plasma/KDE users: "⚠ On Plasma these themes will not work"
- Warning appears directly under the info text, only on Plasma systems
- Improves UX by preventing confusion when GTK themes don't apply in Plasma environments

### Technical Details

- Added `hbox_plasma_warning` that checks `fn.desktop` environment variable (XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP)
- Detects "KDE" or "plasma" (case-insensitive) and conditionally builds warning hbox
- Warning only appends if hbox has children (uses `get_first_child()` guard)
- Uses warning markup with warning CSS class for visual distinction

## 2026.05.07 - AUR helper sync: bidirectional label update between Pacman and Software pages

### What Changed

- **Pacman → Software**: When yay-git or paru-git is installed/removed on the Pacman page, the Software page labels automatically update
- **Software → Pacman**: When yay-git or paru-git is installed/removed on the Software page, the Pacman page buttons automatically update
- User no longer needs to restart ATT or manually navigate to see the correct state on either page

### Technical Details

- **software_gui.py**: Added `refresh_aur_labels()` inner function that re-checks `/usr/bin/yay` and `/usr/bin/paru` and updates `self.lbl_software_yay` and `self.lbl_software_paru` using the same markup pattern as initial build
- **pacman_gui.py**: In `wait_and_refresh()` callback, added `GLib.idle_add(getattr(self, "refresh_software_aur_labels", lambda: None))` calls in both the early-return and normal-flow paths
- **functions.py**: Modified `wait_install_and_update()` and `wait_remove_and_update()` to add `GLib.idle_add(getattr(self_ref, "refresh_aur_buttons", lambda: None))` after label updates, ensuring Pacman buttons refresh when Software page installs/removes
- All paths use `getattr` with defensive lambda guards for safety (both pages are lazy-loaded)
- Follows existing cross-page refresh patterns (kernel tab chaotic-AUR dynamic status)

## 2026.05.06 - Plymouth: Omarchy detection hardened + Reset to default button

### What Changed

- Omarchy detection now uses `/etc/att/att-omarchy-marker` as a stable fallback so the Plymouth tab remains visible even after Plymouth theme changes overwrite `plymouthd.conf`
- Plymouth tab and GUI initialisation guards updated to check `plymouthd.conf` OR the marker file
- Applying any Plymouth theme via ATT automatically writes the marker to `/etc/att/att-omarchy-marker`
- New "Reset to Omarchy default" button runs `plymouth-set-default-theme -R omarchy` and refreshes the active theme label

### Technical Details

- `functions.py` detection extended: `distr = "omarchy"` is set when `plymouthd.conf` contains "omarchy" **or** `/etc/att/att-omarchy-marker` exists
- Both Plymouth guards in `gui.py` use `fn.check_content(...) or fn.os.path.isfile("/etc/att/att-omarchy-marker")`
- Marker written in `run_apply()` thread via `fn.os.makedirs("/etc/att", exist_ok=True)` + `open(...).close()`
- Reset button reuses `refresh_after_apply()` to update `lbl_current` and repopulate the installed-themes dropdown

### Files Modified

## 2026.05.06 - Notification bar: fixed height, replaced image with CSS color

### What Changed

- Replaced `Gtk.Picture` + `Gtk.Overlay` panel image with a plain `Gtk.Box` styled via CSS (`background-color: #1a1a1a`)
- Notification bar is now a fixed 30px tall regardless of window size or tiled WM layout
- Eliminates the aspect-ratio scaling problem where `Gtk.ContentFit.CONTAIN` made the bar grow vertically with window width

### Technical Details

- `panel.png` image is no longer used in the notification bar layout
- `notification_bg` box has `set_size_request(-1, 30)` and CSS class `att-notification-bar`
- CSS provider loaded inline in `gui()` via `Gtk.StyleContext.add_provider_for_display`
- `notification_revealer` has `set_vexpand(False)` to prevent vertical growth

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/gui.py`

## 2026.05.06 - AI tab: OpenCode + GitHub Copilot CLI added; widget rename pass

### What Changed

- Added **OpenCode** (`opencode-ai` npm package) to CLI Coding Assistants section — TUI AI coding assistant used by Omarchy as primary IDE alongside Claude Code
- Added **GitHub Copilot CLI** (`@github/copilot` npm package) to CLI Coding Assistants section
- Both follow the same install/remove/link pattern as existing Codex and Gemini rows
- Renamed all numbered widget variables (`hbox1`–`hbox14`, `btn7`–`btn14`, `lbl7_link`–`lbl14_link`) to descriptive names in `ai_gui.py` (objective 27)

### Technical Details

- Detection checks four paths for each tool: `/usr/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/`, `~/.local/bin/`, `~/.npm-global/bin/`
- Install: `fn.launch_npm_install_in_terminal("opencode-ai")` and `fn.launch_npm_install_in_terminal("@github/copilot")`
- Remove: `fn.launch_npm_remove_in_terminal(...)` — same daemon-thread + `wait()` + `GLib.idle_add` refresh pattern as Codex/Gemini
- Link callbacks: `https://opencode.ai` and `https://github.com/github/gh-copilot`
- Both files pass flake8 clean

## 2026.05.06 - Dev tool: remove-bak-files script

### What Changed

- Added `usr/bin/remove-bak-files` — a developer-only bash script that removes exactly the backup files ATT creates, nothing else

### Technical Details

- Checks 18 specific paths (9 files × both `-bak` and `.bak` variants): `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist`, `/etc/samba/smb.conf`, `/usr/share/icons/default/index.theme`, `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.config/fish/config.fish`, `~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc`
- Uses `SUDO_USER` → `getent passwd` to resolve the real user's home when run as root
- Lists all found files with confirmation prompt before deleting
- Follows ATT Script Standard (tput colors, header/success/warn/error helpers, `set -euo pipefail`)

### Files Modified

- `usr/bin/remove-bak-files` (new)

## 2026.05.06 - Wallpaper: drop XFCE setter, hide picker on full DEs

### What Changed

- Removed `_set_xfce()` entirely — XFCE manages its own wallpaper; ATT no longer attempts xfconf-query
- Removed `_XFCE_STYLES` dict and the `xfce_running` pgrep check from `_apply_x11()`
- Added `_HIDE_PICKER_DESKTOPS` frozenset: GNOME, Unity, KDE, XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, X-Cinnamon, Budgie, Deepin, LXQt, LXDE, Pantheon
- Added `should_show_picker()` — returns `False` for any desktop in the hide list, `True` for WMs and unknown environments
- ATT Wallpaper Picker section (folder browser, thumbnails, preview, apply, random) is now invisible on full DEs that manage wallpaper themselves; Variety and ATT Configuration sections remain always visible
- Replaced `pwd.getpwnam()` in `on_open_variety_settings()` with `subprocess id -u` to remove the `pwd` import dependency
- Removed `import pwd` and `import shlex` (XFCE-only); `import re` retained for `_fix_variety_conf_paths()`

### Technical Details

- `should_show_picker()` reuses `_get_user_env()` for the same pkexec-safe env lookup already used by `_apply_x11()`; KDE checked via `KDE_FULL_SESSION=true` as a fallback since its `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP` value varies
- `wallpaper_gui.py`: all picker widgets packed into a single `box_picker` (Gtk.Box VERTICAL); one `box_picker.set_visible()` call controls the whole section
- Test: `sudo XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME python3 archlinux-tweak-tool.py` — picker hidden; `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=i3` — picker visible

## 2026.05.05 - Wallpaper: XFCE detection and xfconf-query fixes

### What Changed

- XFCE is now detected reliably when ATT runs as root (pkexec strips env vars): `_get_user_env()` reads `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, `DESKTOP_SESSION`, and `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP` from the real user's `/proc/<pid>/environ` as fallback
- `_set_xfce()` now runs `xfconf-query` as the real user with the correct D-Bus session env (`sudo -u <user> XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=... DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=...`) — same pattern as variety settings
- `xfconf-query` calls now use `--create` flag in a single command (replaces the old two-step empty-string pre-set)
- xrandr fallback added for fresh XFCE installs with no existing backdrop props; its `FileNotFoundError` is caught separately so it can't mask xfconf errors
- `shutil.which("xfconf-query")` with `/usr/bin/xfconf-query` hardcoded fallback handles root's restricted PATH
- Debug output now shows the resolved xfconf-query path and every command before execution
- XFCE wallpaper via D-Bus not yet confirmed working — tracked as S11

### Technical Details

- `_get_user_env()` iterates `/proc/*/environ`, matches on `LOGNAME == sudo_username`, extracts requested keys; short-circuits if current env already has the values (non-sudo case)
- `shlex.quote(path)` used in all shell=True xfconf-query invocations to handle spaces in paths
- xrandr fallback constructs `/backdrop/screen0/monitor<output>/workspace0/last-image` per connected output; falls back to `monitor0` if xrandr absent

## 2026.05.05 - Launcher: silent xauth retry loop

### What Changed

- Removed the `[WARN]` echo lines from the X11 xauth retry loop in the launcher script — the loop now retries silently up to 5 times without printing to the terminal

### Technical Details

- The loop itself is unchanged; only the `echo "[WARN]: Xauth changes honored = no, retrying..."` and the post-loop "still no after 5s" warning were removed; the retry logic and `sleep 1` remain intact

### Files Modified

- `usr/bin/archlinux-tweak-tool`

## 2026.05.05 - Shell tab: active shell indicator; Omarchy distro added

### What Changed

- Shell tab stack switcher now labels the currently active shell with "(active)" — e.g. "FISH (active)" — derived from `fn.get_shell()` at GUI construction time
- Added Omarchy to the startup banner's supported distributions list (between Nyarch and ParchLinux)
- Added Omarchy to `DISTRO_TESTING.md` (version 3.7.0-2, <https://omarchy.org>); detection was already present in `functions.py`

### Technical Details

- `fn.get_shell()` reads `pwd.getpwnam(sudo_username).pw_shell` — authoritative login shell regardless of how ATT was launched; `stack.add_titled()` title arg computed inline with a ternary

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/shell_gui.py`
- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/archlinux-tweak-tool.py`
- `DISTRO_TESTING.md`

## 2026.05.05 - Wallpaper: Demote verbose thumb-load message to debug-only

### What Changed

- `_populate_wallpaper_thumbs` log line "Loading wallpapers from: ..." demoted from `log_subsection` to `debug_print` — it fires on every folder change and adds noise to normal console output

### Technical Details

- `log_subsection` is for user-meaningful events; high-frequency internal status lines belong in `debug_print` (only visible with `--debug` flag)

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/wallpaper.py`

## 2026.05.05 - Codebase Review: Consistency, Performance, and Code Quality

### What Changed

- Masterplan task list fully audited — all previously completed tasks marked done
- Full three-agent codebase review (consistency, performance, code quality) run against all Python files
- Fixed 8 GTK callback violations: unused widget param renamed `widget` → `_widget` in `fastfetch.py`, `autostart.py`, `packages.py`
- Renamed all numbered widget names in `autostart.py` (`vbox1`–`vbox6`, `hbox2`–`hbox4`) to descriptive identifiers
- Consolidated three independent implementations of the chaotic-AUR / nemesis repo check into the canonical `fn.check_chaotic_aur_active()` and `fn.check_nemesis_repo_active()`; fixed bug in `check_nemesis_repo_active()` which returned `None` instead of `False` when repo was absent
- Extracted shared icon-scan logic from `maintenance.py` and `sddm.py` into `fn.list_cursor_themes()`; dropped unused `self` param from `sddm.pop_gtk_cursor_names`; removed O(N² log N) in-loop sort
- `/etc/pacman.conf` now cached after first read; all read-only functions use the cache; every write path calls `fn.invalidate_pacman_conf_cache()` — eliminates ~23 redundant file reads at startup
- `user.py` `create_user()` moved to daemon thread via `on_click_user_apply`; `subprocess.call()` replaced with `Popen().wait()`
- Added `fn.display_manager_service` constant; removed duplicate hardcoded path from `sddm.py` and `sddm_gui.py`
- Removed all redundant `f.close()` / `myfile.close()` calls inside `with` blocks across `sddm.py`, `pacman_functions.py`, `insert_repo()`

### Technical Details

- `check_nemesis_repo_active()` / `check_chaotic_aur_active()` in `functions.py` now call `get_pacman_conf_lines()` instead of opening the file; `check_repo()` and `repo_exist()` in `pacman_functions.py` same; cache is a module-level `_pacman_conf_cache` list, invalidated on every write to pacman.conf
- `is_chaotic_aur_enabled()` deleted from `kernel.py` and `pacman_functions.py`; 3 call sites in `kernel_gui.py` and 1 in `pacman_gui.py` redirected to `fn.check_chaotic_aur_active()`
- `fn.list_cursor_themes()` added to `functions.py` using `os.listdir` + `path_check`; both `pop_gtk_cursor_names` functions rewritten to call it; `sddm.py` version drops `self`, removes the in-loop sort at line 303 and the redundant final sort
- `on_click_user_apply` wraps `create_user()` in a `threading.Thread(daemon=True)`; `pop_cbt_users` called via `GLib.idle_add` after thread completes
- All changes pass `flake8 --max-line-length=120`

## 2026.05.05 - Wallpaper Tab: New Page with Variety + ATT Picker

### What Changed

- Added a new **Wallpaper** tab (last entry in sidebar, alphabetically after User)
- Install/Remove variety via alacritty terminal with post-close refresh of button visibility
- Save ATT variety config button copies `data/kiro/variety/` → `~/.config/variety/` with `.bak` of any existing file
- Open variety settings button launches `variety --preferences` in a daemon thread
- ATT Wallpaper Picker: folder entry pre-filled with bundled wallpapers, Browse/Load/Stop controls, async FlowBox thumbnail grid, 180px preview, path label, scale dropdown (Fill/Fit/Center/Tile/Stretch), Apply (feh) and Random buttons
- Bundled wallpapers auto-load on page build via `GLib.idle_add` at PRIORITY_LOW

### Technical Details

- `wallpaper.py`: all backend logic — install/remove variety, save config (shutil.copy2 + .bak), open settings, folder dialog (Gtk.FileDialog + Gio), async thumb loading with generation counter (same stop-signal pattern as SDDM), feh apply via `_FEH_FLAGS` dict, random pick
- `wallpaper_gui.py`: pure UI construction; passes `self.*` widget refs so wallpaper.py callbacks can update them; auto-triggers `_populate_wallpaper_thumbs` on build
- `gui.py`: added `import wallpaper`, `import wallpaper_gui`, `vboxstack_wallpaper`, gui call, and `stack.add_titled` entry
- feh called via `Popen` (non-blocking); `FileNotFoundError` caught and surfaced to user via notification
- All flake8 clean (max-line-length 120)

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/wallpaper.py` (new)

## 2026.05.05 - Shell Tab: Live ZSH UI Rebuild + Dropdown/Image Guards

### What Changed

- Installing oh-my-zsh now populates the theme dropdown immediately; removing it clears the dropdown — no restart required
- Installing zsh from the "not installed" stub now rebuilds the full ZSH tab in-place — no ATT restart required
- Fixed crash in `sddm_gui.py` where `Gtk.Button().get_child()` returned `None` on an empty button
- Fixed crash in `update_image` when `get_combo_text` returns `None` during a dropdown model swap

### Technical Details

- Added `_refresh_zsh_themes_dropdown(self)` in `shell.py`: calls `zsh_theme.get_themes()` when oh-my-zsh-git is installed, sets an empty `StringList` model when it is not; wired into both `install_oh_my_zsh` and `remove_oh_my_zsh` `wait_*` threads via `GLib.idle_add`
- Removed dead `from zsh_theme import get_themes` inline import and redundant `set_sensitive(False)` from `remove_oh_my_zsh`
- Extracted the full "zsh installed" tab content from `gui()` into a module-level `_build_zsh_installed_content(self, vbox, ...)` function in `shell_gui.py`; added `_rebuild_zsh_tab()` which clears `self.zsh_vbox` and calls the builder — avoids circular imports by storing the rebuild as `self._refresh_zsh_tab` lambda at build time
- `on_clicked_install_only_zsh` (which called `restart_program()`) replaced by `on_install_zsh_clicked`: installs via terminal, waits in daemon thread, calls `GLib.idle_add(self._refresh_zsh_tab)` on success
- SDDM fix: replaced `Gtk.Button().get_child().set_markup(...)` with explicit `Gtk.Label` + `set_child()` — `get_child()` is always `None` on a button created without a label argument
- `update_image` guard: early return when `get_combo_text(widget) is None`; the `notify::selected` signal fires transiently during model replacement with no item selected, which previously caused a `TypeError` on string concatenation

## 2026.05.05 - SDDM: Button Compliance Fixes

### What Changed

- All SDDM page buttons now comply with project rules: `_widget` convention, no blocking subprocess calls, all package operations routed through alacritty terminal

### Technical Details

- Removed dead function `ensure_sddm_config` which was never called and contained a blocking `dialog.run()` (deprecated GTK3 pattern)
- Renamed `widget` → `_widget` in 8 callback signatures: `on_browse_sddm_folder`, `on_load_sddm_folder`, `on_stop_sddm_loading`, `on_click_install_bibata_cursor`, `on_click_remove_bibata_cursor`, `on_click_install_bibatar_cursor`, `on_click_remove_bibatar_cursor`, `on_click_att_sddm_clicked`
- Replaced `subprocess.call()` in `on_click_fix_sddm_conf` with `Popen` in a daemon thread so ATT stays responsive while the terminal is open
- Converted 6 package install/remove functions from silent `subprocess.run(["pacman", ...])` to alacritty terminal via `launch_pacman_install_in_terminal` / `launch_pacman_remove_in_terminal` + `wait_and_refresh` daemon threads: bibata cursors (×4), `on_click_sddm_enable`, `on_click_att_sddm_clicked`

### Files Modified

## 2026.05.04 - SDDM: Theme Dropdown Refreshes After Install/Remove

### What Changed

- SDDM theme dropdown now updates immediately after installing or removing the edu-simplicity theme — no app restart required

### Technical Details

- Added `pop_theme_box(self, self.theme_sddm)` at the end of the `refresh()` closure in both `on_click_install_simplicity` and `on_click_remove_simplicity`
- Called on the GLib main thread via the existing `GLib.idle_add(refresh)` path, so no threading changes needed
- `pop_theme_box` clears and repopulates the `Gtk.DropDown` model from `/usr/share/sddm/themes/` and re-selects the currently active theme from `sddm.conf.d`

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/sddm.py`

## 2026.05.04 - Kernel Tab: Dynamic Chaotic-AUR Kernel List Refresh

### What Changed

- Kernel page now hides chaotic-aur kernels automatically when chaotic-aur is removed from pacman.conf, and shows them again when it is re-added — no restart required

### Technical Details

- Kernel rows extracted into a dedicated `vbox_kernels` child `Gtk.Box` inside the page's main container
- New `_populate_kernel_rows()` helper fetches fresh chaotic/installed/cpu/running state and builds all group headers and kernel rows into `vbox_kernels`
- New `_clear_box()` helper removes all children from a box (same pattern used elsewhere for FlowBox clearing)
- GTK `map` signal on `vbox_kernels` fires each time the Kernels tab becomes visible; a `last_chaotic` guard ensures the rebuild only happens when chaotic status actually changed — no-op on normal tab switches

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/kernel_gui.py`

---

## 2026.05.04 - Kernel Tab: Resolve Kernel Package per Boot Entry

### What Changed

- Default-boot-entry dropdown now shows the kernel package alongside the bootctl title, e.g. *"Arch Linux — linux-cachyos-bore"* instead of just *"Arch Linux"*
- `lbl_current` (the "Current:" label below the dropdown) shows the same enriched string instead of the cryptic `.conf` filename
- Orphan boot entries (whose kernel package is no longer installed) are filtered out of the dropdown

### Technical Details

- New helper `_resolve_kernel_for_entry(version, linux_path)` in `kernel.py` returns `(pkg_name, is_orphan)`:
  - With `version:` set → reads `/usr/lib/modules/<version>/pkgbase` (file owned by the kernel package and contains its name) — same trick `get_running_kernel()` already uses; missing file means orphan
  - Without `version:` but with `linux:` basename starting with `vmlinuz-` → strips the prefix to get the pkgbase
  - Otherwise → `(None, False)`; used for firmware/Automatic entries which stay visible with their bootctl title
- `get_boot_entries()` parser rewritten to accumulate fields per blank-line-separated block, capture `version:` and `linux:` in addition to `id:`/`title:`, call the resolver, drop orphans, and return `(id, title, kernel_pkg)` triples
- `_build_boot_entry_selector` and `refresh_combo` in `kernel_gui.py` updated to unpack the new triples; combo label format is `f"{title} — {kernel_pkg}"` when `kernel_pkg` is set, else `title`. Same string is stored in `id_to_title` so the "Current:" label, log lines, and notifications all use the enriched form
- `set_default_boot_entry` still takes the entry id (filename); no change there

## 2026.05.03 - Fastfetch write_configs: Add Missing Section Support

### What Changed

- `write_configs()` now appends `# reporting tools` and the fastfetch line to the shell config when the section is absent, instead of silently returning
- Also handles the case where the section exists but has no fastfetch entry — inserts one after the section header
- Disabling fastfetch on an empty config (no section, no line) still does nothing, as expected

### Technical Details

- Three paths: no section → append section + line (enable only); section exists, no line → insert after header (enable only); line exists → edit in place (existing behaviour)
- Previously the function only knew how to edit an existing `fastfetch` / `#fastfetch` line; bare shell configs like a stock `.bashrc` were silently ignored

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/fastfetch.py`

---

## 2026.05.03 - Fastfetch Shell Config Guard

### What Changed

- Added guard in `on_fast_util_toggled` and `on_fast_lolcat_toggled`: if no shell config file is detected, log a warning and return early instead of silently writing nothing

### Technical Details

- Both toggle handlers now call `utilities.get_config_file()` before `write_configs()`; if it returns falsy, `fn.log_warn("No shell config files found — fastfetch cannot be added to your shell startup")` is emitted and the function returns
- `write_configs()` already had a silent `if not config: return` guard; the new check surfaces that failure to the user visibly

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/fastfetch.py`

## 2026.05.03 - Fastfetch Page Cleanup &amp; Lolcat Install Fix

### What Changed

- Renamed all numbered widget variables in `fastfetch_gui.py` to descriptive names (objective 27)
- Removed dead widget `self.hbox26` — created but never appended to any container
- Removed empty spacer `hbox22` — `hbox_ff_checkboxes` already had `margin_top=10`
- Fixed `on_fast_lolcat_toggled`: lolcat switch now installs the `lolcat` package via terminal if not present; previously it only wrote the shell config with no install, leaving `fastfetch | lolcat` piping to a missing binary

### Technical Details

- Widget renames: `hbox3`→`hbox_title`, `hbox4`→`hbox_separator`, `hbox27`→`hbox_switches`, `hbox9`→`hbox_distro_specific`, `hbox28`→`hbox_amos_note`, `hbox29`→`hbox_archcraft_note`, `lbl1`→`page_title_label`, `label21`→`presets_label`, `label28`→`amos_note_label`, `label29`→`archcraft_note_label`, `hbox9_label`→`distro_specific_label`
- Lolcat fix mirrors the fastfetch install pattern: check `/usr/bin/lolcat`, open install terminal via `fn.launch_pacman_install_in_terminal("lolcat")`, wait in daemon thread, call `write_configs` on success, flip switch back to off if install fails/cancelled
- Dead `lolcat_toggle()` and `util_toggle()` functions still present — not removed as they are out of scope for this session

## 2026.05.03 - Chaotic AUR Setup Script

### What Changed

- `data/bin/setup-chaotic-aur` updated to use locally bundled packages instead of downloading via wget
- Signing key import (`pacman-key --recv-key` / `--lsign-key`) retained — required to verify the package signature before `pacman -U` can proceed
- No changes to `pacman.py`, `pacman_gui.py`, or `pacman_functions.py` — the Chaotic AUR switch and `ensure_chaotic_packages` logic was already fully implemented there

### Technical Details

- Original script used `wget` to fetch packages from `geo-mirror.chaotic.cx` into `/tmp`; replaced with direct paths to `data/chaotic/keyring/chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst` and `data/chaotic/mirrorlist/chaotic-mirrorlist.pkg.tar.zst`
- Key import is still necessary: `chaotic-keyring.pkg.tar.zst` is itself a signed package; pacman verifies its signature before installing, so key `3056513887B78AEB` must be trusted first
- `ensure_chaotic_packages` in `pacman_functions.py` calls the script via `alacritty -e sudo bash setup-chaotic-aur` — no change needed there

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/data/bin/setup-chaotic-aur`

## 2026.05.03 - Fastfetch Remove Button Fix

### What Changed

- `on_remove_fast()` rewritten to use `fn.launch_pacman_remove_in_terminal()`, matching the install pattern used by `on_fast_util_toggled()`
- Detects whether `fastfetch-git` or `fastfetch` is installed before launching the terminal, so the correct package name is passed
- `wait_and_update` thread now calls `process.communicate()` (not `process.wait()`) consistent with the install path

### Technical Details

- Root cause: the original `on_remove_fast` used a hand-rolled `Popen` with `stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE` and `process.wait()` — if alacritty wrote to its stderr, the pipe buffer filled and deadlocked ATT
- `launch_pacman_remove_in_terminal` handles the script, temp-file logging, success/failure messaging, and `read -p 'Press Enter to close...'` prompt in one tested function — no need to duplicate the pattern inline
- Package detection: `pacman -Q fastfetch-git` returns 0 if installed; falls back to `fastfetch` if not found

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/fastfetch.py`

---

## 2026.05.03 - Widget Renaming, Section Headers, Fastfetch Remove, Kernel + Desktopr Fixes

### What Changed

#### Widget Renaming Pass (Objective 27 — No Numbered Boxes)

- All numbered widget names (`hbox1`, `hbox2`, `hbox23`, `vboxstack27`, etc.) renamed to descriptive identifiers across 10+ GUI files
- `performance_gui.py` function parameter `vboxstack27` → `vboxstack_performance`
- `fastfetch_gui.py` several local hboxes promoted to `self.` attributes so `set_fastfetch_ui_sensitive()` can reach them

#### Section Header Markup Consistency (Objective 26)

- `sddm_gui.py` — new **Configuration Setup** section header added using `set_markup("<b>...</b>")`; existing labels converted from `set_text()` to markup
- `performance_gui.py` — **Tuned**, **Zram**, **Preload**, **Irqbalance** section headers converted from `set_name("title")` to `set_markup("<b>...</b>")`
- `logging_gui.py` — new **Journal**, **Pacman Log**, **Xorg Log** section headers added with bold markup
- `system_gui.py` — new **Hardware**, **Storage**, **System**, **Systemd** section headers added (bold label + inline horizontal separator pattern)

#### Fastfetch: Remove Button + Sensitive State Control

- `fastfetch.py` — new `set_fastfetch_ui_sensitive(self, state)` function enables/disables all fastfetch controls when fastfetch is not installed
- `fastfetch.py` — new `on_remove_fast()` remove handler using alacritty terminal with `wait_and_update` daemon thread; after removal disables UI and resets the install switch
- `fastfetch_gui.py` — `set_fastfetch_ui_sensitive()` now called at end of lazy load so initial state is always correct; `on_reset_fast_att` callback parameter fixed `widget` → `_widget`

#### Kernel: Boot Entry Parsing + Non-systemd-boot Message

- `kernel.py` — `get_boot_entries()` now strips any parenthesised suffixes from title (e.g. "Linux (default)" → "Linux") using `re.sub`; entries with "reported/absent" in title are skipped
- `kernel_gui.py` — `_build_boot_entry_unavailable()` added: shown instead of the selector when systemd-boot is not active; informs user the feature requires systemd-boot

#### Desktopr: Refresh Installed Desktops After Install/Remove

- `desktopr.py` — new `refresh_installed_desktops(self)` function rebuilds the "Installed: …" label after an install or removal completes
- `desktopr.py` — `install_desktop()` and `uninstall_desktop()` both call `refresh_installed_desktops` via `GLib.idle_add` on completion; stale `desktopr_stat.set_text()` status updates removed (were updating a widget removed in a prior refactor)
- `desktopr_gui.py` — IMAGE_PREVIEW_LOAD/MIN tuned (900→855, 480→456) to better fit the panel

#### Autostart: Layout Fix

- `autostart.py` — `hbox_add_label` and `hbox2` moved inside `mainbox` (were appended to `vboxstack13` directly, causing layout regression); `scrolled_window.set_vexpand(True)` replaced with `set_propagate_natural_height(True)` to avoid over-expanding

### Technical Details

- Section headers now use two patterns: (a) standalone bold label (per services/logging/sddm model) or (b) bold label + inline `hexpand` separator on the same row (per system_gui model); both are acceptable; pick whichever fits the page density
- `set_fastfetch_ui_sensitive()` iterates a list of `self.` widget references — this is why several fastfetch hboxes were promoted from local vars to instance attributes in the same commit
- Kernel boot entry parsing: `re.sub(r'\s*\([^)]+\)', '', raw_title)` strips ALL parenthesised segments, not just "(default)" — this future-proofs against other suffixes bootctl may add

### Files Modified

`sddm_gui.py` • `performance_gui.py` • `performance.py` • `logging_gui.py` • `system_gui.py` • `fastfetch.py` • `fastfetch_gui.py` • `kernel.py` • `kernel_gui.py` • `desktopr.py` • `desktopr_gui.py` • `autostart.py` • `themes_gui.py` • `packages_gui.py` • `services_gui.py` • `user.py` • `user_gui.py` • `sddm.py` • `gui.py`

---

## 2026.05.03 - UI Layout Consistency: Software Page Section Headers

### What Changed

- **Section headers on software page are now bold** — all 5 section labels (`GUI Package Managers`, `AUR Helpers`, `Flatpak / Snap / AppImage`, `TUI Package Tools`, `Logout Managers`) changed from `set_text()` to `set_markup("<b>...</b>")` to match the system page pattern
- **Layout consistency rule added to CLAUDE.md** — objective 26 now mandates that all pages use `set_markup("<b>...</b>")` for section headers and `set_name("title")` for page titles; any page being edited must have its section labels verified against this standard

### Technical Details

- The system_gui.py pattern (`set_markup("<b>Hardware</b>")`) is now the canonical standard for all section headers across the app
- Page titles continue to use `set_name("title")` for CSS-based styling — no change needed there

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/software_gui.py`
- `CLAUDE.md`

---

## 2026.05.02 - Audio Scripts Migrated to ATT data/bin

### What Changed

- **Audio install buttons now run standalone scripts** — PulseAudio and PipeWire install buttons launch `data/bin/install-pulseaudio.sh` and `data/bin/install-pipewire.sh` in an alacritty terminal instead of executing Python package logic inline
- **Scripts made self-contained** — removed dependency on ArcoLinux-Nemesis `common.sh`; all helper functions (`log_section`, `log_info`, `log_success`, `log_warn`, `pkg_installed`, `install_packages`, `remove_if_installed`) are now defined inline in each script
- **Dead Python logic removed** — `add_autoconnect_pulseaudio()`, `on_click_switch_to_pulseaudio()`, and `on_click_switch_to_pipewire()` inline package logic replaced with a simple `alacritty -e bash -c` launcher following the maintenance.py `_run_terminal` pattern
- **Terminal stays open** — `read -p "Press Enter to close..."` appended via the `bash -c` wrapper so alacritty always waits for input

### Technical Details

- Scripts use `set -euo pipefail`; `read -p` is placed in the outer `bash -c` string (not inside the script) so it runs even when the script exits early via `set -e`
- Both callbacks use `subprocess.Popen(cmd, shell=True).wait()` in a daemon thread; ATT console gets `log_success` + in-app notification when terminal closes
- `systemctl --user` calls in both scripts have `2>/dev/null || true` to fail silently if running in a root context

### Files Modified

- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/data/bin/install-pulseaudio.sh`
- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/data/bin/install-pipewire.sh`
- `usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/services.py`

## 2026.05.02 - M4 Feature Testing: Services Tab Complete, UI Layout Refinement

### What Changed

#### SDDM Settings Save Bug Fix

- **User Context Bug** — Fixed `on_click_sddm_apply()` incorrectly saving settings as root instead of the actual user
  - Root cause: code was using `os.getenv("SUDO_USER") or os.getenv("USER")` which falls back to "root" when environment variables are unset
  - Fix: replaced with `fn.sudo_username` which correctly gets the actual logged-in user via `getlogin()`
  - Impact: SDDM configuration now saves with the correct user in `User=` field instead of `User=root`
  - **Console Logging** — Added user display in SDDM apply output for verification (`User: <username>`)

#### Services Tab — Full Feature Implementation & Testing

- **Audio Server Switching** — Batch PulseAudio and Pipewire installations (all audio, alsa, gstreamer packages in single terminal); added `check_audio_server()` to verify active server after install
- **Bluetooth Operations** — Batch installation (bluez + bluez-utils together); added daemon thread with label updates for enable/disable/restart controls
- **CUPS Printing** — Batch CUPS installation with systemctl controls (enable, disable, restart)
- **CUPS-PDF Printer** — Added dynamic label updates showing installed/not-installed status via `self.cups_pdf_label`
- **Printer Drivers** — Batch installation of all foomatic, gutenprint, ghostscript packages together; dynamic label updates via `self.printer_drivers_label`
- **HP Printer Support (HPLIP)** — Single-package install/remove with label feedback
- **System Config Printer** — GUI tool for printer setup (install/remove/status)
- **Lock File Cleanup** — Added pacman db.lck removal before batch audio server switches to prevent "database is locked" errors during parallel operations
- **Logging Pattern Refinement** — Introduced `fn.log_info_concise()` for visible path logging without verbose headers (complement to `debug_print()`)

#### UI Layout Reorganization (services_gui.py)

- **Section-Based Headers** — Divided printing section into four logical sections:
  - **CUPS Service** — contains CUPS install/remove controls
  - **Printer Drivers** — contains foomatic/gutenprint/ghostscript batch installation
  - **Tools** — contains system-config-printer and HP drivers (HPLIP)
  - **Status** — shows current CUPS service and socket status (active/inactive)
- **Consistent Label Styling** — All labels use 3-space indentation prefix and hexpand=True for alignment
- **Dynamic Status Labels** — Cups-pdf and printer drivers labels update after install/remove operations showing "Installed" status
- **Dynamic Service Status** — CUPS service status label refreshes after enable/disable/restart operations via `update_cups_status()` callback
- **Section Spacing** — Added 20px top margin before Status header to separate service controls from status display

#### Logging Pattern Addition (functions.py)

- **`log_info_concise()` function** — New logging function that outputs bare `print()` for concise multi-line operations; used for source→target paths in pacman, file copy, and shell operations; complements existing `debug_print()` (--debug only) and `log_info()` (with headers)

#### Other Module Updates

- **maintenance.py** — Added `fn.log_info_concise()` calls to GPG config operations for visible file path logging
- **shell.py** — Updated bashrc operations to use `fn.log_info_concise()` for visible path logging instead of bare `print()`

### Technical Details

- **Batch Pacman Operations** — All package installations use `fn.launch_pacman_install_in_terminal()` and removals use `fn.launch_pacman_remove_in_terminal()` to prevent multiple alacritty windows and database lock contention
- **Label Updates Pattern** — Store UI labels as `self.cups_pdf_label`, `self.printer_drivers_label`, `self.cups_status_label` in GUI init, then call `.set_markup()` in callback functions after terminal operations complete
- **Dynamic Status Refresh** — `update_cups_status()` function in services.py checks current `fn.check_service("cups")` and `fn.check_socket("cups")` status, called from on_click_enable_cups, on_click_disable_cups, on_click_restart_cups to refresh label via `GLib.idle_add()`
- **Lock File Handling** — Check for and remove `/var/lib/pacman/db.lck` before launching audio server switches; prevents cascading errors during rapid pacman calls
- **Section Headers** — Four section titles (CUPS Service, Printer Drivers, Tools, Status) with bold markup and horizontal separators; each section groups related controls
- **Logging Layers**:
  - `fn.log_section()` — major headers (green with separators)
  - `fn.log_subsection()` — feature headers (cyan)
  - `fn.log_info()` — blue headers with messages
  - `fn.log_info_concise()` — bare print for path logging (new)
  - `fn.debug_print()` — `--debug` flag only

## 2026.05.02 - Code Cleanup Complete: All S/M/L Tasks Done, Ready for M4 Feature Testing

### What Changed

#### Small Tasks (S1–S10) — All Complete

- ✓ S1: flake8 installed and configured (ignore: E402, W503, W504, E128, E203)
- ✓ S2: Pending deletions committed (100+ files)
- ✓ S3–S6: Arco ref cleanup in maintenance.py, services_gui.py, desktopr_gui.py, support.py — **no refs found** (already clean)
- ✓ S7–S8: **NOT MERGING** (functions_sddm.py, functions_makedir.py stay separate per agreement)
- ✓ S9: TODO/FIXME audit — **no markers found** (already clean)
- ✓ S10: Flake8 linting complete — codebase passes with configured ignores

#### Medium Tasks (M1–M5) — All Complete

- ✓ M1: Arco refs in 6 files (functions.py, network_gui.py, shell.py, pacman.py, services.py, pacman_functions.py) — only `change_distro_label()` multi-distro support (intentional, keep)
- ✓ M2: desktopr.py — only `/etc/skel/.config/arco-chadwm` folder path (intentional, keep)
- ✓ M3: shell_gui.py — no arco refs found (already clean)
- ✓ M5: data/kiro/ population — finished

#### Large Tasks (L1–L2) — All Complete (Confirmed Intentional)

- ✓ L1: themes_gui.py — all 109 refs are real AUR package names (`arcolinux-arc-*-git`) — **SKIP, NEVER CHANGE**
- ✓ L2: themes.py — all 547 refs are real AUR package names (`arcolinux-arc-*-git`) — **SKIP, NEVER CHANGE**

#### Memory Updates

- Confirmed: `arco-chadwm` folder is CRITICAL system path — never rename
- Confirmed: `arcolinux-arc-*` package names are upstream AUR packages — never rename
- Confirmed: `change_distro_label()` is intentional multi-distro support — keep all entries
- Added: Auto-fix flake8 violations without asking permission
- Added: Never establish git tags (user's explicit ban)

### Technical Details

All code cleanup tasks systematically completed. No real arco/brand references remain except:

1. Multi-distro support in `change_distro_label()` (intentional)
2. Real AUR package names in themes modules (untouchable)
3. System folder path `/etc/skel/.config/arco-chadwm` (untouchable)

Codebase lint-clean with flake8. All Small/Medium/Large refactor tasks done.

### Files Modified

`.flake8` • `CHANGELOG.md` • Memory files (5 updated)

### Next Milestone

**M4 Feature Completeness Test** — 18 tabs on Kiro (Packages, SDDM, Shell, Maintenance, Services, Themes, Icons, Themer, Desktopr, Fastfetch, Performance, Kernel, User, AI, Network, Software, System, Logging, Privacy, Autostart)

---

## 2026.05.02 - Code Quality: Themer Refactoring, Linting, Brand Cleanup

### What Changed

#### Themer Module Refactoring (themer.py / themer_gui.py)

- **GTK4 StringList population optimized** — dropdown initialization changed from one-by-one `append()` to batch `splice()` with full list; resolves empty dropdowns on first load
- **qtile theme detection fixed** — `isfile()` check replaced with `path_check()` for directory validation (line 54 and 353); UnboundLocalError on qtile theme load now resolved
- **on_polybar_toggle callback signature corrected** — changed from `(self, widget, active)` to `(self, _widget, _pspec=None)` to match GTK4 notify::active signal; polybar checkbox now functions
- **Theme name extraction refactored** — replaced `range(len(...))` loops with `enumerate()` pattern per PEP 8; removed accompanying TODO comments
- **Dead debug output removed** — removed temporary debug print statements used during troubleshooting
- **fn.readlink corrected** — changed incorrect `fn.readlink` to `fn.os.readlink` (line 354)

#### Brand Name Cleanup (4 Files)

- **shell_gui.py** — UI message updated: "Activate the ArcoLinux repos" → "Activate the nemesis repo (when needed)" (line 154)
- **functions_startup.py** — Startup message updated: "installing default from ARCO template" → "installing default from ATT template"
- **desktopr_gui.py** — Removed non-existent `button_reinstall.set_sensitive()` call that was causing AttributeError (only `button_install` exists)
- **gui.py** — Removed deprecated `fastfetch_message.set_markup()` call entirely (fastfetch config section now message-free)

#### Linting & Code Quality (Multiple Files)

- **E241 fixed** — `shell.py` and `shell.py`: Removed alignment spaces after commas in package tuples (lines 326-334)
- **E226 fixed** — `functions.py`: Added whitespace around operators (`i+1` → `i + 1`)
- **E128 fixed** — `functions.py`: Reformatted multi-line `subprocess.run()` calls with proper indentation
- **E501 fixed** — `desktopr.py`: Split long lines at 637 and 659 to ≤120 characters
- **flake8 audit complete** — all remaining violations addressed; codebase now lint-clean

#### Startup Timer Refinement (archlinux-tweak-tool.py)

- Removed `print()` statement for total startup time; kept debug-only output via `fn.debug_print()`
- Added `[RESPONSIVE]` timer message marking when initialization completes and UI is ready for interaction

#### Documentation Updates (CLAUDE.md)

- **Requirements section added** — Python 3.8+, GTK4 4.6+, system tools, optional features documented
- **Objective 12 clarified** — "Data Folder Consolidation: Transition to Kiro-only data folder; update all paths before removing other distro-specific directories"

#### Memory & Developer Notes

- Created `distro_guards_intentional.md` — documents that `fn.distr` detection guards throughout codebase are intentional multi-distro support features, not code to be removed

### Technical Details

- GTK4 StringList splice pattern: build complete list with `[item1, item2, ...]`, then `model.splice(0, 0, full_list)` to populate in one operation
- enumerate() pattern: `for i, item in enumerate(items):` replaces `for i in range(len(items)):`
- qtile_config_theme is a directory (`~/.config/qtile/config.py`), not a file; requires `fn.path_check()` not `fn.isfile()`
- Brand reference policy: remove brand names from user-facing UI messages ("ArcoLinux" → "ATT", "ARCO template" → "ATT template"); preserve real package names (arcolinux-arc-*) and real folder names (/etc/skel/.config/arco-chadwm)

### Files Modified

`themer.py` • `themer_gui.py` • `shell_gui.py` • `shell.py` • `functions.py` • `functions_startup.py` • `desktopr_gui.py` • `gui.py` • `archlinux-tweak-tool.py` • `CLAUDE.md` • `CHANGELOG.md`

## 2026.05.02 - XFCE Removal: Force Removal with Smart Cleanup

### What Changed

- **XFCE now uses `-Rdd` (force removal)** like Plasma, since XFCE has complex inter-package and external dependencies
- **Detects installed panel variant** — checks for both `xfce4-panel` (default) and `xfce4-panel-compiz`, removes only what's installed
- **Two-stage cleanup** — main removal of core packages + cleanup step that removes all plugins and ecosystem apps
- **Comprehensive package removal** includes:
  - All `xfce4-*` plugins (30+ variants: battery, clipman, cpufreq, cpugraph, dict, diskperf, eyes, fsguard, genmon, mailwatch, mount, mpc, netload, notes, notifyd, places, pulseaudio, screenshooter, sensors, smartbookmark, systemload, time-out, timer, verve, wavelan, weather, whiskermenu, xkb, etc.)
  - XFCE ecosystem apps: mousepad, parole, ristretto, xfburn
  - Thunar derivatives: thunar-archive-plugin, thunar-media-tags-plugin
- **UX improvements**: backup warning shows "might take a while", package list displayed before removal confirmation

### Technical Details

- Panel detection: `fn.check_package_installed("xfce4-panel")` and `fn.check_package_installed("xfce4-panel-compiz")`
- Panel replacement: removes compiz variant from list, inserts actual installed variant
- Filter logic: protects all `xfce4-*` except the detected panel variant + other package categories
- Cleanup: two-pronged approach:
  - `pacman -Rdd $(pacman -Q | grep '^xfce' | awk '{print $1}')` for all xfce4-* packages
  - Explicit removal of mousepad, parole, ristretto, xfburn, thunar plugins
- All in one `-Rdd` command with `--noconfirm` to bypass dependency checks

### Why `-Rdd` for XFCE

Like Plasma, XFCE has many plugins and ecosystem apps that create a complex dependency web:

- 30+ xfce4-*-plugin packages require xfce4-panel
- parole (media player) requires xfconf, tumbler, libxfce4ui
- ristretto (image viewer) requires exo, xfconf, tumbler, libxfce4ui
- xfburn (CD/DVD) requires libxfce4ui, exo
- Thunar plugins require thunar
- User may have additional packages (xfce4-screensaver, xfce4-taskmanager, etc.)

Using `-Rs` (respects dependencies) fails due to circular dependencies and external references. Force removal (`-Rdd`) cleanly removes the entire environment in one operation.

## 2026.05.02 - Desktop UI: Consolidate Install/Re-Install into Single Button

### What Changed

- **Merged Install and Re-Install buttons** into single "Install" button in `desktopr_gui.py`:
  - Removed `self.button_reinstall` entirely (was redundant after terminal-first refactor)
  - Updated install button connection to use new `on_install_clicked(self, _widget)` signature (no state parameter)
  - Changed checkbox label from "Select to clear cache before re-install" to "Clear package cache before installation"
  - Checkbox is always visible and functional for both install and reinstall workflows
- **Simplified install flow in desktopr.py**:
  - Removed `state` parameter from `on_install_clicked()`, `check_lock()`, and `install_desktop()` functions
  - All install paths now use same branch (unified logic)
  - Cache clearing still available via always-visible checkbox
- **Rationale:** After terminal-first refactor, Install and Re-Install had identical logic; consolidation removes duplication and simplifies UX

### Technical Details

- `check_lock()` signature changed: `def check_lock(self, desktop, state):` → `def check_lock(self, desktop):`
- `install_desktop()` signature changed: `def install_desktop(self, desktop, state):` → `def install_desktop(self, desktop):`
- `on_install_clicked()` signature changed: `def on_install_clicked(self, widget, state):` → `def on_install_clicked(self, _widget):`
- Removed all conditional `if state == "reinst":` branches; cache clear logic now uniform: `if self.ch1.get_active(): cache_clear = ...`
- Updated both Thread argument tuples in `check_lock()` to pass only `(self, fn.get_combo_text(self.d_combo))`

## 2026.05.02 - Desktop Uninstall: Label Feedback Instead of Messagebox

### What Changed

- **uninstall_desktop() UX improved** — removed messagebox, replaced with label feedback:
  - After removal completes, display removal message directly in `desktop_status` label
  - Message shows: "[desktop] has been removed" + "We do not remove code from your home directory..."
  - Message auto-clears after 5 seconds (GLib.timeout_add)
  - Label updates to "This desktop is NOT installed" after timeout
- **Rationale:** Less intrusive than modal dialog; user sees result inline with UI; automatic cleanup

## 2026.05.02 - Install Desktop: Terminal-First Pattern with Transparency

### What Changed

- **install_desktop() refactored** to use alacritty terminal-first pattern (like uninstall):
  - Opens alacritty terminal before installation begins
  - Shows complete list of packages to be installed
  - Displays actual `pacman -S` command
  - User reviews and presses Enter to confirm
  - Installation runs visibly in terminal (not in background)
  - Shows "=== Installation Complete ===" and waits for Enter to close
- **Backup happens first** — ~/.config backed up to ~/.config-att/ BEFORE terminal opens (early, safe)
- **Cache clear option preserved** — if "Re-Install" + checkbox enabled, cache cleared in terminal before install
- **Config copy still happens after** — only if installation succeeds (check_desktop confirms)
- **3-channel logging preserved** — console output shows progress at key milestones; debug output shows implementation details

### Technical Details

- Build bash script string with full package list displayed + install command visible
- Launch via `alacritty -e bash -c` in daemon thread so ATT stays responsive
- After terminal closes, check if desktop installed before copying configs
- Uses `GLib.idle_add` for UI updates from daemon thread
- Console logging unchanged: log_section, log_subsection, log_info, log_success preserved

## 2026.05.02 - 3-Channel Communication in Desktop Install/Uninstall

### What Changed

- **install_desktop() communication enhanced** with 3-channel logging:
  - **In-app notification** — "Starting installation...", "[package] installed", completion status
  - **Console (always-visible)** — `log_section` at start, `log_subsection` for package count, `log_info` for backup/copy operations, `log_success` on completion, `log_error` on failure
  - **Debug output** — detailed package list, return codes, copy paths, error details (via `fn.debug_print`)
- **uninstall_desktop() communication enhanced** with same 3-channel pattern:
  - **In-app notification** — removal start/completion status
  - **Console** — `log_section` at start, `log_info` for package filtering details, `log_success` on completion
  - **Debug output** — package lists, filtering logic, completion notes
- **Transparency principle:** User can now follow the entire install/uninstall process in console without needing `--debug` flag; debug output provides implementation details

### Technical Details

- Install flow: backup notification → package count subsection → per-package info lines → completion success
- Uninstall flow: removal start section → filtered package count → removal completion
- All operations show source→target details in debug mode but only key milestones in normal console output
- Alacritty terminal still uses "Press Enter to close" pattern for user confirmation

## 2026.05.02 - Desktop Uninstall Feature

### What Changed

- **New uninstall_desktop() function** in `desktopr.py` — safely removes desktop environment packages while preserving:
  - Essential packages: alacritty, feh, dmenu, noto-fonts, thunar (and all thunar plugins), xfce4-* family
  - Packages used by other installed desktops (no breaking dependencies)
  - User home directory (never modified)
- **on_uninstall_clicked() callback** — checks if desktop is installed before uninstall; shows notification if not installed
- **Remove Desktop button** in `desktopr_gui.py` — new uninstall_hbox with single button, reuses existing dropdown selector
- **Terminal display** — alacritty shows `pacman -R [packages]` with user confirmation
- **Completion messagebox** — displays "The desktop [name] has been removed. We do not remove code from your home directory, only apps without dependencies"
- **Daemon threading** — terminal launches in background thread, ATT stays responsive

### Technical Details

- Package filtering: iterate through all desktops, build set of "packages used elsewhere", exclude those from removal list
- Essential list is hardcoded (never changes); regex check for xfce4-* prefix handles all xfce metapackages
- Uses same terminal pattern as install: Popen + daemon thread + messagebox completion dialog
- Remove command shown to user first (transparency principle)

## 2026.05.02 - Final F401 Cleanup — Unused Imports Removed & Intentional Exports Restored

### What Changed

- **F401 unused imports removed** — achieved flake8 compliance by distinguishing truly unused imports from intentional re-exports
- `archlinux-tweak-tool.py` — removed: `subprocess`, `datetime`, `desktopr_gui`, `utilities`; removed `Gio` from `gi.repository`; removed `from os import readlink`; removed unused global `att`
- `functions.py` — removed truly unused: `rmdir`, `walk` from os; removed duplicate `import sys` and `import subprocess`
- **Intentional re-exports restored with `# noqa: F401`** — marked imports that are deliberately exported for dependent modules to use via `fn.*` pattern:
  - `getpid` — used by `archlinux-tweak-tool.py` as `fn.getpid()`
  - `stat` — used by `functions_startup.py` as `fn.stat()`
  - `system` — used by `user.py`, `services.py` as `fn.system()`
  - `readlink` — used by `themer_gui.py` as `fn.readlink()`
  - `Queue` — used by `packages_gui.py` as `fn.Queue`

### Technical Details

- Re-exports are intentional module design: import something into functions.py namespace so dependent code can access it via `fn.*` without knowing the original module
- Distinguishing re-exports from truly unused imports prevents breaking runtime code during lint cleanup
- All marked with `# noqa: F401` to suppress flake8 checks

- **F401** unused imports removed: `fastfetch.py` (×2), `functions_makedir.py`, `gui.py`, `packages.py`, `packages_gui.py`
- Skipped: `E402` (intentional import order), `E128` (style preference), `E203` (slice style), F401 in `functions.py` (exports used via `fn.*`), F401 in `archlinux-tweak-tool.py` (startup imports)

## 2026.05.01 - Privacy Tab Rewrite

### What Changed

- `privacy.py` — replaced stub `set_ublock_firefox` and blocking `set_hblock` switch callbacks with six button callbacks: install/remove for uBlock Origin, install/remove for hblock, enable/disable for hblock; enable/disable run in daemon threads with pulsing progress bar
- `privacy_gui.py` — replaced switches with install/remove button rows for both uBlock and hblock; added enable/disable row for hblock with live enabled/disabled status label; sections separated by horizontal separator; progress bar restored

## 2026.05.01 - System Tab New Features

### What Changed

- `system.py` — added `hbox_partitionmanager` row: Launch/install button (installs via alacritty terminal then auto-launches) + Remove button with install guard
- `system.py` — added `hbox_gparted` Remove button with install guard
- `system_gui.py` — `self.lbl_gparted` and `self.lbl_partitionmanager` use `set_markup()` with conditional `<b>installed</b>` suffix — status visible on load
- `system.py` — `_refresh_gparted_label` and `_refresh_partitionmanager_label` helpers refresh label markup after install and after remove terminal closes (daemon thread + `GLib.idle_add`)
- `system.py` — `_pm_launch_cmd()` helper builds the partitionmanager launch command as the real user (`sudo -u username` + `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` + `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` + `DISPLAY` + `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`) — required because KDE/Qt apps need the user session environment and fail silently when launched as root
- Both files pass `flake8 --max-line-length=120` with zero errors

## 2026.05.01 - System Tab Cleanup

### What Changed

- `system.py` — `widget` → `_widget` in all 18 callbacks
- `system.py` — all `fn.subprocess.call()` replaced with `_run_cmd()` helper (Popen in daemon thread) — keeps ATT responsive while terminal viewers are open
- `system.py` — added module-level `_run_cmd(cmd)` helper to avoid repeating the Popen+daemon-thread pattern 18 times
- `system.py` — `import pwd` and `import time` moved from inside functions to top-level imports
- `system.py` — `on_click_system_gparted`: removed `&` from gparted launch command (unnecessary with Popen); `import time` removed from nested function
- `system.py` — E501 fixed: services_enabled and memory_disk command strings split across lines
- `system_gui.py` — `hbox1`–`hbox18` renamed to descriptive names: `hbox_cpu`, `hbox_memory_disk`, `hbox_lsblk`, `hbox_lspci`, `hbox_lsusb`, `hbox_lsmod`, `hbox_inxi`, `hbox_hwinfo`, `hbox_fdisk`, `hbox_fstab`, `hbox_hostnamectl`, `hbox_localectl`, `hbox_services`, `hbox_services_enabled`, `hbox_services_failed`, `hbox_timers_enabled`, `hbox_dmesg`, `hbox_gparted`
- `system_gui.py` — label variables renamed from `hbox1_label` pattern to `lbl_*` prefix; button variables renamed from `btn1` to `btn_*` with descriptive suffix
- Both files pass `flake8 --max-line-length=120` with zero errors

## 2026.05.01 - User Tab Cleanup

### What Changed

- `user.py` — critical bug fixed: `on_click_delete_user` and `on_click_delete_all_user` were each defined twice; the outer callback shadowed the inner implementation, causing the inner logic to be unreachable and the callback to call itself recursively. Inner implementations renamed to `_do_delete_user` and `_do_delete_all_user`; callbacks now call those
- `user.py` — `widget` → `_widget` in all 3 callbacks
- `user.py` — `pop_cbt_users` line 117: two statements on one line split to two; local variable renamed `_m` → `model` for clarity
- `user.py` — redundant duplicate `if password == confirm_password` guard removed
- `user_gui.py` — dead `import user` removed (module is passed as parameter, shadowed the import)
- `user_gui.py` — parameter `vboxStack10` → `vboxstack_user` (snake_case)
- `user_gui.py` — all numbered box variables renamed to descriptive names: `hbox_title`, `hbox_separator`, `hbox_admin_info`, `hbox_apply`, `hbox_delete_title`, `hbox_delete_separator`, `hbox_delete_warning`, `hbox_user_select`, `hbox_delete_all`, `hbox_delete_only`, `hbox_visudo`
- Both files pass `flake8 --max-line-length=120` with zero errors

- `software.py` — `fn.subprocess.call()` → `fn.subprocess.Popen()` in `on_click_software_appimagelauncher` launch path
- `software.py` — all 37 E501 line-length violations fixed (long `wait_install_and_update`, `wait_remove_and_update`, and `GLib.idle_add` calls wrapped to multiple lines)
- `software_gui.py` — `hbox1`–`hbox16` renamed to descriptive names: `hbox_pamac`, `hbox_octopi`, `hbox_gnome`, `hbox_discover`, `hbox_bauh`, `hbox_yay`, `hbox_paru`, `hbox_trizen`, `hbox_pikaur`, `hbox_flatpak`, `hbox_snapd`, `hbox_appimage`, `hbox_pacseek`, `hbox_pacui`, `hbox_archlinux_logout`, `hbox_powermenu`

- `themes_gui.py` — typo fixed: `"arcolinux-arc-tangerinex"` → `"arcolinux-arc-tangerine"`
- `themes_gui.py` — local box variables renamed to descriptive names: `hbox10` → `hbox_info`, `hbox11` → `hbox_checkboxes`, `hbox18` → `hbox_presets`, `hbox19` → `hbox_actions`

### Technical Details

- `self.arcolinux_arc_*` widget attributes are intentionally named after real AUR packages (`arcolinux-arc-*-git`) — not renamed
- All helper calls (`fn.wait_and_notify`, `fn.launch_pacman_install_in_terminal`, `fn.launch_pacman_remove_in_terminal`) confirmed present and correct

## 2026.04.30 - Performance Tab Overhaul

### What Changed

#### `performance.py` — full terminal pattern migration

- **Template applied to all packages with services** — tuned, irqbalance, ananicy, gamemode now all follow the single-terminal pattern: install = `pacman -S` + `systemctl enable --now` in one window; remove = `systemctl disable --now` + `pacman -R` in one window
- **`install_tuned_tools`** — rewritten as `_do_install` daemon thread; removes power-profiles-daemon first (waits for terminal to close), then installs tuned + tuned-ppd and enables both services in one combined terminal; already-installed guard added
- **`remove_tuned_tools`** — `_do_remove` daemon thread; disables and removes tuned + tuned-ppd in one combined terminal
- **`enable_tuned_services` / `disable_tuned_services` / `restart_tuned_service` / `restart_tuned_ppd_service`** — all converted from silent `fn.enable_service` calls to alacritty inline scripts with daemon `_wait_` threads
- **`self.tuned_package_label`** — renamed from local `hbox7_label` so callbacks can refresh it after install/remove; `refresh_tuned_package_label` added
- **`install_irqbalance`** — rewritten as daemon thread with combined install+enable terminal; already-installed guard added
- **`remove_irqbalance`** — daemon thread with combined disable+remove terminal; not-installed guard added
- **`enable_irqbalance_service` / `disable_irqbalance_service`** — converted to alacritty terminals with `_wait_` daemon threads
- **`install_ananicy`** — daemon thread with combined install+enable terminal; already-installed guard
- **`remove_ananicy`** — daemon thread with combined disable+remove terminal; not-installed guard
- **`enable_ananicy_service` / `disable_ananicy_service`** — alacritty terminals with `_wait_` daemon threads
- **`install_gamemode`** — daemon thread with combined install+enable terminal; bash user-detection block (`PKEXEC_UID` → `SUDO_USER` → `logname`) for gamemoded user service; already-installed guard
- **`remove_gamemode`** — daemon thread with disable+remove terminal; bash user-detection for gamemoded; not-installed guard
- **`enable_gamemode_service` / `disable_gamemode_service`** — alacritty terminals with bash user-detection and `_wait_` daemon threads
- **`run_gamemoded_user_command`** — removed (dead code; superseded by inline bash scripts)
- **`enable_fstrim_timer` / `disable_fstrim_timer` / `run_fstrim_now`** — converted from silent `subprocess.call` to alacritty inline scripts with `read -p`
- **`enable_zram` / `disable_zram` / `create_swapfile` / `remove_swapfile`** — all inlined into `bash -c` Popen calls; removed dependency on external script files; `trap 'read -p "Press Enter to close..."' EXIT` added so window stays open on any exit path including errors and unsupported filesystem
- **External script constants removed** — `zram_enable_script`, `zram_disable_script`, `swapfile_create_script`, `swapfile_remove_script` removed from module-level constants

#### `data/bin/` — defensive hardening

- **`create-swapfile`**, **`remove-swapfile`**, **`enable-zram`**, **`disable-zram`** — all four scripts now have `trap 'echo; read -p "Press Enter to close..."' EXIT` at the top; explicit `read -p` at end removed (trap handles it); scripts remain usable standalone

### Technical Details

- External script paths (`/usr/share/archlinux-tweak-tool/data/bin/`) fail silently in dev environments (scripts not installed there); inlining avoids the path issue entirely
- `trap ... EXIT` in bash fires on any exit — normal, `exit 1`, unhandled error — guaranteeing the terminal window stays open
- Gamemode uses `systemctl --user --machine="${REAL_USER}@.host"` because gamemoded is a user service; bash chain detects real user via `$PKEXEC_UID` (getent) → `$SUDO_USER` → `logname`
- All `GLib.timeout_add(500, ...)` replaced with `GLib.idle_add(...)` for immediate refresh after `proc.wait()`

- **`--debug` detail added** — all irqbalance, ananicy, and gamemode functions now emit `fn.debug_print()` calls showing: which terminal commands are about to run, real user detected (gamemode), "Waiting for X terminal to close...", "Terminal closed — refreshing labels"; enable/disable service functions also show their `systemctl` command before the terminal opens
- **Performance tab frozen** — `performance.py` and `performance_gui.py` added to frozen files list

## 2026.04.30 - Network Tab Overhaul

### What Changed

#### Network tab (`network_gui.py` / `services.py` / `functions.py`)

- **Thunar plugin removed** — `install_arco_thunar_plugin` button, `hbox19` block, `on_click_install_arco_thunar_plugin` callback and broken `fn.install_arco_thunar_plugin` ref all deleted; ATT no longer uses thunar/nemo share plugins
- **nsswitch dropdown** — replaced raw `hosts:` strings with short labels (`Standard (no mdns)`, `With mdns + wins`, etc.); mapping label → hosts: string lives in `choose_nsswitch`; dropdown is now readable
- **`copy_nsswitch` bug fixed** — was writing values without `hosts:` prefix, corrupting the file after first apply; now writes `hosts: <values>` so all five presets save correctly
- **`choose_nsswitch` logging** — added `log_subsection`, `debug_print` (preset name + hosts: line being written), `log_success`, `show_in_app_notification`; unknown preset now logs a `log_warn` instead of silently doing nothing
- **Install/uninstall network discovery** — both rewritten to open alacritty terminal with all commands visible (pacman + systemctl); Popen in daemon thread; ATT stays responsive
- **Uninstall discovery** — no longer attempts package removal (avahi is often a shared dependency); shows note in terminal with manual removal command; wording corrected from "removed" to "disabled"
- **Install/uninstall samba** — both rewritten to match discovery pattern: alacritty terminal, all commands visible, daemon thread, `log_subsection` + notification inside function
- **Create samba user** — rewrote to use bash script in alacritty with `smbpasswd`; terminal now stays open with `read -p`; guards against missing smbpasswd (samba not installed); Popen + daemon thread
- **Shared folder dialog** — `choose_smb_conf` now checks if `~/Shared` exists; if not, shows YES/NO `Gtk.MessageDialog` before creating it; folder creation removed from `copy_samba` and moved to the confirmed response handler

#### Memory

- **Install/uninstall pattern** saved to memory — all future install/uninstall operations must use alacritty terminal with all commands visible, daemon thread, `log_subsection` inside function; transparency is a core project principle
- **`change_distro_label()`** added to do-not-touch memory — display-only function covering all Arch-based distros ATT runs on; never remove entries

### Technical Details

- `nsswitch_options` dict in `choose_nsswitch` maps short label → full `hosts:` string; `copy_nsswitch` receives only the values, prepends `"hosts: "` before writing
- All terminal scripts follow: commands → result echo → `=== Operation Finished ===` → `read -p 'Press Enter to close...'`
- `set_secondary_text` removed (not available in GTK4); dialog text consolidated into `text=` parameter
- `create_samba_user` uses `command -v smbpasswd` check in bash — cleaner than hardcoded path

`network_gui.py` • `services.py` • `functions.py` • `CHANGELOG.md`

## 2026.04.30 - Maintenance Tab Freeze, SDDM Fix Keys Script, Keyring & GPG Fixes

### What Changed

#### Maintenance tab (maintenance.py)

- **`_run_terminal` helper added** — all 9 alacritty `subprocess.call` launches converted to `Popen` + daemon thread; ATT no longer freezes while terminal is open
- **`widget` → `_widget`** — all callback parameters renamed project-wide convention
- **`fn.install_package` removed** from callbacks for tools assumed present (alacritty, hw-probe, reflector)
- **Pacman cache cleanup** — `on_click_clean_cache` now removes leftover `download-*` temp directories before `pacman -Sc`; uses `compgen -G` to check existence first so the "Temp download files removed" line only prints when files actually existed; console `log_info` likewise only fires when temp files are present
- **Keyring local install fixed** — `str(files).strip("[]'")` replaced with proper list filter (`f.endswith(".pkg.tar.zst")`) + `os.path.join`; same fix applied to online download path
- **GPG conf reset cleaned up** — removed noisy content dump and stacked `"=" * 70` separators from both `on_click_fix_pacman_gpg_conf` and `on_click_fix_pacman_gpg_conf_local`; output is now three lines: subsection header, optional backup line, success

#### `functions.py` — `install_local_package`

- `debug_print` on success/failure replaced with `log_success` / `log_error` so result is always visible without `--debug`

#### Fix keys script (`data/bin/fix-pacman-databases-and-keys`)

- Full rewrite with colour helpers (`separator`, `header`, `success`, `warn`, `info`) matching `fix-sddm-config` style
- `pacman -Sy` and keyring download now guarded by `$Online` flag — both steps skipped with a `warn` when offline

#### SDDM page — Fix SDDM config button

- **`on_click_fix_sddm_conf`** added to `sddm.py` with `confirm_dialog` before running the script
- **"Fix SDDM config" button** added to `sddm_gui.py` right-aligned in `hbox_wp_btns` via expanding spacer
- **`data/bin/fix-sddm-config`** rewritten with colour/structure, online/offline fallback, live-user setting patch

### Technical Details

- `_run_terminal(self, cmd, done_msg, start_msg=None)`: `Popen(cmd, shell=True).wait()` in daemon thread; `GLib.idle_add` fires notification on GTK thread when done
- `compgen -G "/var/cache/pacman/pkg/download-*"` used in bash to test glob match without triggering errors on no-match
- `rm -rf` (not `-f`) required because `download-*` entries are directories, not files
- Keyring filter: `[f for f in fn.listdir(pathway) if f.endswith(".pkg.tar.zst")]` — rejects `.pkg.tar.zst.1` partial download fragments

## 2026.04.30 - Icons Tab, Fastfetch Startup Fix, Codebase Flake8, SDDM Wallpaper

### What Changed

#### Icons tab (icons.py / icons_gui.py)

- **Layout restructured** — all three sub-tabs (Sardi, Surfn, Neo Candy) now share the same consistent layout pattern:
  - Info label row
  - FlowBox of checkboxes (`set_column_spacing(4)`, `set_row_spacing(4)` for tighter grid)
  - Preview image (with lightbox — click to open full-size modal)
  - "Choose icon theme(s)" label + buttons on their own centred row
  - "Choose family / type" label + buttons on their own centred row (where applicable)
  - Centred action buttons row (install)
  - Centred uninstall button on its own separate row
- **Lightbox added** — clicking the preview image in any sub-tab opens a `Gtk.Window` (modal, 960×720) showing the full-size image; Escape key or click on image closes it
- **Dead code removed** — two never-called Surfn callbacks (`on_click_att_surfn_theming_normal_selection`, `on_click_att_surfn_theming_minimal_selection`) deleted; commented-out Normal/Minimal button blocks removed
- **`_widget` convention applied** — all 18 callback `widget` parameters renamed to `_widget` across `icons.py`
- **`log_info` added** — all 6 early-return paths in `icons.py` (empty package list) now log before returning so the user knows why nothing happened
- **All 26 generic widget names renamed** to descriptive names throughout `icons_gui.py` (e.g. `hbox20` → `hbox_sardi_title`, `hbox29` → `hbox_surfn_actions`, `vboxstack4` → `vbox_neocandy_tab`)

#### Fastfetch startup fix (fastfetch.py / fastfetch_gui.py)

- **Initializing flag pattern applied** — `self.ff_initializing = True` set before programmatic `set_active()` calls in the lazy-load function; `on_fast_util_toggled` and `on_fast_lolcat_toggled` return immediately if flag is set
- Startup no longer prints "Fastfetch enabled/disabled" when the page is first loaded; user-triggered toggles still log normally

#### Codebase-wide flake8 fixes (19 files)

- **autopep8** fixed 104 E302 (missing 2 blank lines between functions) and 9 E303 (too many blank lines) violations across 19 Python source files
- **36 F541 bare f-strings** fixed — f-strings with no `{}` placeholders had the `f` prefix stripped
- **`functions.py` `wait_and_notify`** — changed `debug_print(notification)` → `log_success(notification)` so install/remove completion messages are always visible (two-street logging pattern)

#### SDDM Wallpaper Section & Dead Code Removal (earlier in same day)

- **SDDM page — Simplicity theme wallpaper section fully wired:**
  - Browse folder, Load, Stop, folder entry, Apply wallpaper, Restore default — all greyed out when `edu-sddm-simplicity-git` is not installed
  - "Install Simplicity theme" button shown right-aligned when not installed; hidden after install
  - "Remove Simplicity theme" button shown after install; hidden after removal
  - Both buttons use `wait_and_refresh` daemon thread — re-enables or disables all widgets after terminal closes, no reboot required (objective 2: In-App Updating)
  - On remove: flowbox thumbnails cleared, loader cancelled via `_sddm_load_gen` increment, preview reset to `data/wallpaper/wallpaper.jpg` fallback, `login_wallpaper_path` cleared
  - Fallback wallpaper path derived from `__file__` so it resolves correctly in both dev and installed environments
  - `set_paintable(None)` called before `set_filename()` to force GTK4 to clear the cached image
- **`functions_sddm.py` wired correctly:** `setup_sddm_config()` now called only when user clicks "Apply the above mentioned settings" — not at startup (non-invasive, objective 9)
- **`support.py` deleted** — `Support` dialog was never instantiated; all dead references removed from `archlinux-tweak-tool.py`
- **`maintenance.py`** — fixed script path: `arcolinux-fix-pacman-conf` → `att-fix-pacman-conf` at ATT data path
- **`desktopr_gui.py`** — removed dead commented-out arco repo button line
- **`CLAUDE.md` objective 11** — corrected from "Kiro-only" to multi-distro scope: ATT targets all Arch-based systems; `fn.distr` guards are intentional and must not be removed

### Technical Details

- Lightbox uses `Gtk.GestureClick` on the preview frame; opens a `Gtk.Window` with `set_transient_for`, `set_modal(True)`, `Gtk.EventControllerKey` for Escape close
- `frame.set_cursor(Gdk.Cursor.new_from_name("pointer"))` signals the frame is clickable without any extra label
- `ff_initializing` guard: `if getattr(self, 'ff_initializing', False): return` at top of both toggle handlers — safe even if attribute doesn't exist yet
- F541 multi-line string fix: adjacent string literals where `f""` prefix was on a leading empty string were rewritten as plain `set_markup()` calls
- `setup_sddm_config(self, sys.modules["sddm"])` called at top of `on_click_sddm_apply`; passes already-loaded sddm module to avoid circular import
- `sddm.py` / `sddm_gui.py` — autologin switch reads current state from config on startup; Bibata install/remove buttons guard against already-installed/removed state
- `user.py` — `on_click_delete_user` and `on_click_delete_all_user` missing `_widget` parameter fixed
- `maintenance_gui.py` — label renamed to "Get the original ATT /etc/pacman.conf" (naming convention: use ATT not distro names in UI labels)
- **flake8 installed** and `.flake8` confirmed configured (max-line-length = 120)
- **AI tab** confirmed frozen — no errors on Kiro

## 2026.04.29 - Pacman Page — Full Fix & Freeze

### What Changed

- All pacman repo switches now work correctly — toggling enables/disables repos in `/etc/pacman.conf`
- AUR helper buttons (Install/Remove yay-git, paru-git) update their labels immediately after terminal closes
- Reset pacman ATT and Reset pacman local now refresh all switches after applying
- Blank pacman button restored — was disappearing due to GTK4 double-parent conflict
- Bottom button row (reset/edit) left-aligned to match "Apply custom repo" button above
- `chaotic_aur_repo` constant added to `functions.py`
- `arch_community_testing_repo` reference removed — that repo does not exist
- Pacman files marked frozen: `pacman_gui.py`, `pacman.py`, `pacman_functions.py`

### Technical Details

- Root cause of non-functional switches: `self.opened` always `True` (dead code blocking `toggle_test_repos`); `self.initializing` never cleared (stuck `True` after startup)
- Fix: removed `if self.opened is False:` guards; added `self.initializing = False` at end of `_finish_background_init()`
- Blank pacman disappearance: `blank_pacman` appended to `hboxstack4` first, second append to `hboxstack_blank_pacman` silently failed (widget already had parent), then `hboxstack4.remove()` orphaned it; fixed by only adding to `hboxstack_blank_pacman`
- AUR label refresh: install/remove functions now return `Popen` object; GUI uses `wait_and_refresh` daemon thread that calls `process.wait()` then `GLib.idle_add(refresh_aur_buttons)`
- `init_repos_lazy_load` and `update_repos_switches` both guard `set_active()` calls with `self.initializing = True/finally: False` to suppress spurious toggle callbacks

## 2026.04.29 - Project Planning & Developer Objectives

### What Changed

- Developer Objectives expanded — added objectives 15–24 covering GTK4 best practices, consistent naming, no duplicate functions, effective Claude usage, model selection guidance, plan mode policy, project-driven development, lint standards, and automatic changelog maintenance
- Project Plan added to CLAUDE.md — 5-milestone roadmap targeting v1.0 release by 2026-05-29; includes current state snapshot, per-milestone deliverables, packaging checkpoints, and a risk register
- Workflow section added to CLAUDE.md — priority task checklist (must-do before any real work), session start/end checklists, task size guide, and full S/M/L task list with checkboxes

### Technical Details

- Priority tasks identified: install flake8, commit ~100 pending deletions, verify app launches, audit data/kiro/ gaps, tag `pre-m1` baseline
- Task inventory based on live codebase analysis: 723 arco/garuda refs remaining across 14 modules; `themes.py` alone has 547 refs (largest single task) - eos needs to be removed too
- `functions_backup.py` confirmed NOT dead code — imported in `archlinux-tweak-tool.py`; marked for consolidation into `functions.py` instead
- Markdownlint config created: `siblings_only: true` for MD024 (CHANGELOG duplicate headings), MD013 line-length disabled

### S1 — Install flake8 ✓

- `python-flake8` installed via VS Code extension + `sudo pacman -S python-flake8` (v7.3.0)
- `.flake8` config created: `max-line-length = 120`, `functions_backup.py` excluded
- Baseline run: **436 issues** across all modules

| Count | Code | Issue |
| ----- | ---- | ----- |
| 133 | E302 | Missing 2 blank lines between functions |
| 111 | E501 | Lines over 120 chars |
| 40 | F541 | f-strings with no `{}` placeholders |
| 24 | E402 | Module-level imports not at top of file |
| 22 | F401 | Unused imports |
| 22 | E722 | Bare `except:` clauses |
| 17 | W293 | Blank lines containing whitespace |
| 15 | F811 | Duplicate imports |
| 11 | F841 | Variables assigned but never used |
| 6 | F821 | **Undefined name `arepo`** — real bug, needs investigation |
| 6 | E203 | Whitespace before `:` |
| 8 | E702 | Multiple statements on one line |

### F821 Undefined Names — pending fix

`arepo` confirmed removed (no references found — already cleaned up with deleted arco files).
Four remaining F821 bugs to fix next session:

| File | Line | Undefined name | Likely cause |
| ---- | ---- | -------------- | ------------ |
| `icons.py` | 89 | `set_att_checkboxes_theming_surfn_icons_normal` | Function removed or renamed |
| `icons.py` | 96 | `set_att_checkboxes_theming_surfn_icons_minimal` | Function removed or renamed |
| `maintenance_gui.py` | 93 | `fn` | Missing `import functions as fn` |
| `themer.py` | 596 | `readlink` | Should be `os.readlink` |

## 2026.04.28 - Startup Performance & Responsiveness Optimization

### What Changed

- Lazy Loading Architecture: All page switch initialization deferred until page access
- Eliminated blocking operations at startup for instant responsiveness
- Privacy page optimization: 110x speedup (2.985s → 0.027s)
- Removed `init_switch_states()` function entirely
- Added comprehensive timing instrumentation with `[RESPONSIVE]` and `[LAZY]` markers
- Optimized `hblock_get_state()`: subprocess call → direct Python file I/O

### Performance Results

```text
                        BEFORE      AFTER       IMPROVEMENT
App responsive:         2.7s    →   1.67s       38% faster
Privacy page delay:     4.47s   →   0.027s      165x faster
Total startup:          2.7s    →   1.72s       36% faster
UI frozen duration:     2.7s    →   0s          Instant
```

### Technical Details

- Privacy callbacks now return early when `initializing=True` to skip expensive `fn.set_hblock()` and similar operations
- All lazy load messages unified under `fn.debug_print()` for consistent behavior
- Each page (Privacy, Themer, Fastfetch, Pacman repos, SDDM) loads switches asynchronously with `GLib.idle_add(PRIORITY_LOW)`
- Debug output respects `--debug` flag for clean console

## 2026.04.26 - Software Menu Enhancement

### What Changed

- Software menu now has standardized installation flow across all package managers
- Install buttons check if package is already installed before offering installation
- All GUI package managers (Pamac, Octopi, GNOME Software, KDE Discover, Bauh) auto-launch after installation
- TUI tools (Pacseek, Pacui) now have full install+launch logic
- Terminal output includes verbose [INFO] logging: waiting, completion, binary check, launch status
- Labels show `installed` suffix only after successful installation
- New section: Logout Managers (archlinux-logout-gtk4-git, edu-powermenu-git from nemesis_repo)

### Technical Details

- AUR helpers, Flatpak, Snapd, App-manager all updated with verbose logging
- Pre-check for already-installed packages prevents redundant installs
- Missing repository notifications specify repo names (nemesis_repo, chaotic-aur)
- Removal process logs final completion message
- gparted gains install+launch logic with logging

## 2026.04.21 - Network & Software Menus Added

### Network Menu

- New sidebar menu with two tabs: Network and Samba
- Network tab: network discovery, nsswitch.conf
- Samba tab: samba server setup, config, user creation, file manager plugins
- Moved out of Services page (which now shows Audio, Bluetooth, Printing only)

### Software Menu

- New sidebar menu with four sections:
  - GUI Package Managers (Pamac, Octopi, GNOME Software, KDE Discover, Bauh)

  - Flatpak / Snap / AppImage
  - TUI Package Tools (Pacseek, Pacui)
- Labels show `installed` when binary is detected

### Technical Details

- AUR-only packages (snapd, app-manager) detect available AUR helper; priority order: yay → paru → trizen → pikaur
- Installs via alacritty with in-app notification if no helper found
- GNOME apps require HOME + XDG_RUNTIME_DIR + DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS when launched from root
- Flatpak and Snapd terminal output improved with usage hints
